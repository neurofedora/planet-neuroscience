	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Hybrid Active Inference. (arXiv:1810.02647v1 [cs.AI])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02647</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02647</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We describe a framework of hybrid cognition by formulating a hybrid cognitive
agent that performs hierarchical active inference across a human and a machine
part. We suggest that, in addition to enhancing human cognitive functions with
an intelligent and adaptive interface, integrated cognitive processing could
accelerate emergent properties within artificial intelligence. To establish
this, a machine learning part learns to integrate into human cognition by
explaining away multi-modal sensory measurements from the environment and
physiology simultaneously with the brain signal. With ongoing training, the
amount of predictable brain signal increases. This lends the agent the ability
to self-supervise on increasingly high levels of cognitive processing in order
to further minimize surprise in predicting the brain signal. Furthermore, with
increasing level of integration, the access to sensory information about
environment and physiology is substituted with access to their representation
in the brain. While integrating into a joint embodiment of human and machine,
human action and perception are treated as the machine's own. The framework can
be implemented with invasive as well as non-invasive sensors for environment,
body and brain interfacing. Online and offline training with different machine
learning approaches are thinkable. Building on previous research on shared
representation learning, we suggest a first implementation leading towards
hybrid active inference with non-invasive brain interfacing and state of the
art probabilistic deep learning methods. We further discuss how implementation
might have effect on the meta-cognitive abilities of the described agent and
suggest that with adequate implementation the machine part can continue to
execute and build upon the learned cognitive processes autonomously.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning can extract information from neural recordings, e.g.,
surface EEG, ECoG and {\mu}ECoG, and therefore plays an important role in many
research and clinical applications. Deep learning with artificial neural
networks has recently seen increasing attention as a new approach in brain
signal decoding. Here, we apply a deep learning approach using convolutional
neural networks to {\mu}ECoG data obtained with a wireless, chronically
implanted system in an ovine animal model. Regularized linear discriminant
analysis (rLDA), a filter bank component spatial pattern (FBCSP) algorithm and
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) were applied to auditory evoked
responses captured by {\mu}ECoG. We show that compared with rLDA and FBCSP,
significantly higher decoding accuracy can be obtained by ConvNets trained in
an end-to-end manner, i.e., without any predefined signal features. Deep
learning thus proves a promising technique for {\mu}ECoG-based brain-machine
interfacing applications.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence algorithms are capable of fantastic exploits, yet
they are still grossly inefficient compared with the brain's ability to learn
from few exemplars or solve problems that have not been explicitly defined.
What is the secret that the evolution of human intelligence has unlocked?
Generalization is one answer, but there is more to it. The brain does not
directly solve difficult problems, it is able to recast them into new and more
tractable problems. Here we propose a model whereby higher cognitive functions
profoundly interact with reinforcement learning to drastically reduce the
degrees of freedom of the search space, simplifying complex problems and
fostering more efficient learning.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Single cell analyses of the effects of Amyloid-beta42 and Interleukin-4 on neural stem/progenitor cell plasticity in adult zebrafish brain</title>

	<description>Neural stem cells (NSCs) constitute the reservoir for new cells and might be harnessed for stem cell-based regenerative therapies. Zebrafish has remarkable ability to regenerate its brain by inducing NSC plasticity upon Alzheimer's pathology. We recently identified that NSCs enhance their proliferation and neurogenic outcome in an Amyloid-beta42-based (A{beta}42) experimental Alzheimer's disease model in zebrafish brain and Interleukin-4 (IL4) is a critical molecule for inducing NSC proliferation in AD conditions. However, the mechanisms by which A{beta}42 and IL4 affect NSCs remained unknown. Using single cell transcriptomics, we determined distinct subtypes of NSCs and neurons in adult zebrafish brain, identified differentially expressed genes after A{beta}42 and IL4 treatments, analyzed the gene ontology and pathways that are affected by A{beta}42 and IL4, and investigated how cell-cell communication is altered through secreted molecules and their receptors. Our results constitute the most extensive resource in the Alzheimer's disease model of adult zebrafish brain, are likely to provide unique insights into how A{beta}42/IL4 affects NSC plasticity and yield in novel drug targets for mobilizing neural stem cells for endogenous neuro-regeneration.</description>

	<description>Genes implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are enriched with chromatin regulators, but the mechanisms leading to the abnormal behavior and cognition are still unclear. Animal models are crucial for studying the effects of mutations on brain function and behavior. We generated conditional knockout mice with brain-specific mutation in Pogz, a heterochromatin regulator recurrently mutated in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders, and demonstrated that these mice display phenotypes that resemble the human condition. Pogz deficiency led to smaller brain, growth impairment, motor learning deficits, and increased social interactions that mimic the human overly friendly phenotype. At the molecular level, reporter assay indicated that POGZ functions as a negative regulator of transcription through its interaction with HP1 proteins. In accordance, we found a significant upregulation of gene expression, most notably in the cerebellum. Furthermore, Pogz deficiency was associated with a significant reduction in the firing frequency of simple and complex spikes in cerebellar Purkinje cells with no changes in their intrinsic properties. Overall, our findings support a mechanism linking heterochromatin dysregulation to cerebellar circuit dysfunction and to motor and social abnormalities in ASD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Functional Connectivity of Corticostriatal Circuitry and Psychosis-Like Experiences in the General Community</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/437376v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Background: Psychotic symptoms are proposed lie on a continuum, ranging from isolated psychosis-like experiences (PLEs) in non-clinical populations to frank disorder. Here, we investigate neurobiological correlates of this symptomatologic continuum by examining whether functional connectivity of dorsal corticostriatal circuitry, which is disrupted in patients and high-risk individuals, is associated with the severity of subclinical PLEs. Methods: A community sample of 672 adults with no history of psychiatric or neurological illnesses completed a battery of seven questionnaires spanning various PLE domains. Principal component analysis (PCA) estimated major dimensions of PLEs from the questionnaires. PCA dimension scores were then correlated with whole-brain voxelwise functional connectivity (FC) maps of the striatum in a subset of 353 participants who completed a resting-state neuroimaging protocol. Results: PCA identified two dimensions of PLEs accounting for 62.57% of variance in the measures, corresponding to positive and negative PLEs. Reduced FC between the dorsal striatum and prefrontal cortex correlated with higher positive PLEs. Negative PLEs correlated with increased FC between the dorsal striatum and visual and sensorimotor areas. In the ventral corticostriatal system, positive and negative PLEs were both associated with FC between the ventro-rostral putamen and sensorimotor cortices. Conclusions: Consistent with past findings in patients and high-risk individuals, subthreshold positive symptomatology is associated with reduced FC of the dorsal circuit. These findings suggest that the connectivity of this circuit tracks the expression of psychotic phenomena across a broad spectrum of severity, extending from the subclinical domain to clinical diagnosis.</description>

	<description>Functional connectome fingerprints are partially heritable. Specifically, a higher heritability of high-order associative networks, which are greatly variable between individuals, has been proposed. However, such an interpretation relies on linear assumptions for the heritability inference and does not take into account the influence of the number of nodes on connectome fingerprinting analyses, since associative networks tend to include more brain regions. To overcome these limitations, we considered stable individual factors to estimate the relative genetic influence on whole-brain and eigenvector centrality-based networks of fixed size using the Human Connectome Project twin dataset. Individual identification accuracies were found to be higher in networks including more central nodes (94%) than the ones comprising peripheral nodes (22%). Nonetheless, the inferred additive genetic influence was more prominent in networks comprising peripheral nodes (50%) than hubs' networks (28%). Our results suggest that a brain hub's backbone is individually unique and less heritable than the connectivity profile of a subset of peripheral regions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Beta-band activity in medial prefrontal cortex predicts source memory encoding and retrieval accuracy</title>

	<description>Reality monitoring is defined as the ability to distinguish internally self-generated information from externally-derived information. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a key brain region subserving reality monitoring and has been shown to be activated specifically during the retrieval of self-generated information. However, it is unclear if mPFC is activated during the encoding of self-generated information into memory. If so, it is important to understand whether successful retrieval of self-generated information critically depends on enhanced neural activity within mPFC during initial encoding of this self-generated information. We used magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEGI) to determine the timing and location of cortical activity during a reality-monitoring task involving self generated contextual source memory encoding and retrieval. We found both during encoding and retrieval of self-generated information, when compared to externally-derived information, mPFC showed significant task induced oscillatory power modulation in the beta-band. During initial encoding of self-generated information, greater mPFC beta-band power reductions occurred within a time window of -700ms to -500ms prior to vocalization, activity in mPFC that was not observed during encoding of externally-derived information. This mPFC activity during encoding of self-generated information predicted subsequent retrieval accuracy of self-generated information. Beta-band activity in mPFC was also observed during the initial retrieval of self-generated information within a time window of 300 to 500ms following stimulus onset and correlated with accurate retrieval performance of self-generated information. Together, these results further highlight the importance of mPFC in mediating the initial generation and awareness of participants internal thoughts.</description>

	<description>Ongoing, spontaneous fluctuations in neural excitability and in network-wide activity patterns before stimulus onset have been proposed to underlie variability in near-threshold stimulus detection paradigms, i.e. whether an object is perceived or not. Here, we investigated the impact of pre-stimulus neural fluctuations on the content of perception, i.e. whether one or another object is perceived. We recorded neural activity with magnetoencephalography before and while participants briefly viewed a bi-stable image, the Rubin face/vase illusion, and required them to report their perceived interpretation on each trial. Using multi-variate pattern analysis, we showed robust decoding of the perceptual report during the post-stimulus period. Applying source localization to the classifier weights suggested early recruitment of V1 and ~160 ms recruitment of category-sensitive FFA. These post-stimulus effects were driven by stronger oscillatory power in the gamma frequency band for face vs vase reports. In pre-stimulus intervals, we found no differences in oscillatory power between face vs. vase reports in V1 nor in FFA, indicating similar levels of neural excitability. Despite this, we found stronger connectivity between V1 and FFA prior to face reports for low-frequency oscillations. Specifically, the strength of pre-stimulus feedback connectivity (i.e. Granger causality) from FFA to V1 predicted not only the category of the upcoming percept, but also the strength of post-stimulus neural activity associated with the percept. Our work identifies pre-stimulus network states that shape future processing in category-sensitive brain regions and in this way determine the content of visual experiences.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Classical-contextual interactions in V1 may rely on dendritic computations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/436956v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>A signature feature of the neocortex is the dense network of horizontal connections (HCs) through which pyramidal neurons (PNs) exchange contextual information. In primary visual cortex (V1), HCs are thought to facilitate boundary detection, a crucial operation for object recognition, but how HCs modulate PN responses to boundary cues within their classical receptive fields (CRF) remains unknown. We began by consulting natural images, through a structured data collection and ground truth labeling process, what function a V1 cell should use to compute boundary probability from aligned edge cues within and outside its CRF. The answer was an asymmetric 2D sigmoidal function, whose nonlinear form provides the first normative account for the multiplicative center-flanker interactions previously reported in V1 neurons (Kapadia et al. 1995, 2000; Polat et al. 1998). Using a detailed compartmental model, we then show that this boundary-detecting classical-contextual interaction function can be computed with near perfect accuracy by NMDAR-dependent spatial synaptic interactions within PN dendrites, the site where classical and contextual inputs first converge in the cortex. In additional simulations, we show that local interneuron circuitry activated by HCs can powerfully leverage the nonlinear spatial computing capabilities of PN dendrites, providing the cortex with a highly flexible substrate for integration of classical and contextual information.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Detecting object boundaries in natural images requires \'incitatory\' cell-cell interactions</title>

	<description>Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell (BC), and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a BC from a population of conventional &quot;simple cells&quot; (SCs), we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes' rule to determine how an SC should affect a BC depending on its offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three types of cell-cell interactions: monotonic excitatory and inhibitory, with various thresholds, slopes, and amplitudes, and a spectrum of non-monotonic (U-shaped) interactions. Using simple models we show a common cortical circuit motif consisting of monosynaptic excitation and disynaptic inhibition - an arrangement we call &quot;incitation&quot; - can produce the entire spectrum of SC-BC interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize the incitation circuit can be learned by a simple (1-layer) gradient descent learning rule. We conclude that trainable incitatory interconnections may be a general computational mechanism used by the cortex to help solve difficult natural classification problems.</description>

	<description>Reality monitoring is defined as the ability to distinguish internally self-generated information from externally-derived information. Functional imaging studies have consistently found that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a key brain region subserving reality monitoring. The aim of this study was to determine a causal role for mPFC in reality monitoring using navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS). In a subject-blinded sham-controlled crossover design, healthy individuals received either active or sham nrTMS targeting mPFC. Active modulation of mPFC using rTMS at a frequency of 10 Hz, significantly improved identification of both self-generated and externally-derived information during reality monitoring, when compared to sham or baseline. Targeted excitatory modulation of mPFC also improved positive mood ratings, reduced negative mood ratings and increased overall alertness/arousal. These results establish both the dosing and tolerability for nrTMS targeting of mPFC. Importantly, these findings provide the first direct evidence that mPFC plays a causal role in reality monitoring and mood.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: High Sensitivity Mapping of Cortical Dopamine D2 Receptor Expressing Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical D2 dopamine receptor (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/span&gt;) have mostly been examined in the context of cognitive function regulation and neurotransmission modulation of medial prefrontal cortex by principal neurons and parvalbumin positive, fast-spiking, interneurons in schizophrenia. Early studies suggested the presence of D2 receptors in several cortical areas, albeit with major technical limitations. We used combinations of transgenic reporter systems, recombinase activated viral vectors, quantitative translatome analysis, and high sensitivity in situ hybridization to identify D2 receptor expressing cells and establish a map of their respective projections. Our results identified previously uncharacterized clusters of D2 expressing neurons in limbic and sensory regions of the adult mouse brain cortex. Characterization of these clusters by translatome analysis and cell type specific labeling revealed highly heterogeneous expression of D2 receptors in principal neurons and various populations of interneurons across cortical areas. Transcript enrichment analysis also demonstrated variable levels of D2 receptor expression and several orphan G-protein-coupled receptors coexpression in different neuronal clusters, thus suggesting strategies for genetic and therapeutic targeting of D2 expressing neurons in specific cortical areas. These results pave the way for a thorough re-examination of cortical D2 receptor functions, which could provide information about neuronal circuits involved in psychotic and mood disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Diadenosine-Polyphosphate Analogue AppCH2ppA Suppresses Seizures by Enhancing Adenosine Signaling in the Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epilepsy is a multifactorial disorder associated with neuronal hyperexcitability that affects more than 1% of the human population. It has long been known that adenosine can reduce seizure generation in animal models of epilepsies. However, in addition to various side effects, the instability of adenosine has precluded its use as an anticonvulsant treatment. Here we report that a stable analogue of diadenosine-tetraphosphate: AppCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ppA effectively suppresses spontaneous epileptiform activity in vitro and in vivo in a Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) mouse model (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Tsc1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), and in postsurgery cortical samples from TSC human patients. These effects are mediated by enhanced adenosine signaling in the cortex post local neuronal adenosine release. The released adenosine induces A1 receptor-dependent activation of potassium channels thereby reducing neuronal excitability, temporal summation, and hypersynchronicity. AppCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ppA does not cause any disturbances of the main vital autonomous functions of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Tsc1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/&lt;/span&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; mice in vivo. Therefore, we propose this compound to be a potent new candidate for adenosine-related treatment strategies to suppress intractable epilepsies.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Psychiatric conditions marked by impairments in cognitive control often emerge during adolescence, when the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its inputs undergo structural and functional maturation and are vulnerable to disruption by external events. It is not known, however, whether there exists a specific temporal window within the broad range of adolescence when the development of PFC circuitry and its related behaviors are sensitive to disruption. Here we show, in male mice, that repeated exposure to amphetamine during early adolescence leads to impaired behavioral inhibition, aberrant PFC dopamine connectivity, and reduced PFC dopamine function in adulthood. Remarkably, these deficits are not observed following exposure to the exact same amphetamine regimen at later times. These findings demonstrate that there is a critical period for the disruption of the adolescent maturation of cognitive control and PFC dopamine function and suggest that early adolescence is particularly relevant to the emergence of psychopathology in humans.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Saccadic Adaptation Boosts Ongoing Gamma Activity in a Subsequent Visuoattentional Task</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Attention and saccadic adaptation (SA) are critical components of visual perception, the former enhancing sensory processing of selected objects, the latter maintaining the eye movements accuracy toward them. Recent studies propelled the hypothesis of a tight functional coupling between these mechanisms, possibly due to shared neural substrates. Here, we used magnetoencephalography to investigate for the first time the neurophysiological bases of this coupling and of SA per se. We compared visual discrimination performance of 12 healthy subjects before and after SA. Eye movements and magnetic signals were recorded continuously. Analyses focused on gamma band activity (GBA) during the pretarget period of the discrimination and the saccadic tasks. We found that GBA increases after SA. This increase was found in the right hemisphere for both postadaptation saccadic and discrimination tasks. For the latter, GBA also increased in the left hemisphere. We conclude that oculomotor plasticity involves GBA modulation within an extended neural network which persists after SA, suggesting a possible role of gamma oscillations in the coupling between SA and attention.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Representing Multiple Observed Actions in the Motor System</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy237/5122730?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;There is now converging evidence that others’ actions are represented in the motor system. However, social cognition requires us to represent not only the actions but also the interactions of others. To do so, it is imperative that the motor system can represent multiple observed actions. The current fMRI study investigated whether this is possible by measuring brain activity from 29 participants while they observed 2 right hands performing sign language gestures. Three key results were obtained. First, brain activity in the premotor and parietal motor cortex was stronger when 2 hands performed 2 different gestures than when 1 hand performed a single gesture. Second, both individual observed gestures could be decoded from brain activity in the same 2 regions. Third, observing 2 different gestures compared with 2 identical gestures activated brain areas related to motor conflict, and this activity was correlated with parietal motor activity. Together, these results show that the motor system is able to represent multiple observed actions, and as such reveal a potential mechanism by which third-party social encounters could be processed in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Imaging changes in membrane potential using genetically encoded fluorescent voltage indicators (GEVIs) has great potential for monitoring neuronal activity with high spatial and temporal resolution. Brightness and photostability of fluorescent proteins and rhodopsins have limited the utility of existing GEVIs. We engineered a novel GEVI, Voltron, that utilizes bright and photostable synthetic dyes instead of protein-based fluorophores, extending the combined duration of imaging and number of neurons imaged simultaneously by more than tenfold relative to existing GEVIs. We used Voltron for in vivo voltage imaging in mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies. In mouse cortex, Voltron allowed single-trial recording of spikes and subthreshold voltage signals from dozens of neurons simultaneously, over 15 minutes of continuous imaging. In larval zebrafish, Voltron enabled the precise correlation of spike timing with behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A computational model of the escape response latency in the Giant Fiber System of Drosophila melanogaster</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/435362v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/435362v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The Giant Fiber System (GFS) is a multi-component neuronal pathway mediating rapid escape response in the adult fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster, usually in the face of a threatening visual stimulus. Two branches of the circuit promote the response by stimulating an escape jump followed by flight initiation. Our recent work demonstrated an age-associated decline in the speed of signal propagation through the circuit, measured as the stimulus-to-muscle depolarization response latency. The decline is likely due to the diminishing number of inter-neuronal gap junctions in the GFS of ageing flies. In this work, we presented a realistic conductance-based, computational model of the GFS that recapitulates our experimental results and identifies some of the critical anatomical and physiological components governing the circuit's response latency. According to our model, anatomical properties of the GFS neurons have a stronger impact on the transmission than neuronal membrane conductance densities. The model provides testable predictions for the effect of experimental interventions on the circuit's performance in young and ageing flies.</description>

Recent advances in epigenomics have made it possible to map genome-wide regulatory regions using empirical methods. Subsequent comparative epigenomic studies have revealed that regulatory regions diverge rapidly between genome of different species, and that the divergence is more pronounced in enhancers than in promoters. To understand genomic changes underlying these patterns, we investigated if we can identify specific sequence fragments that are over-enriched in regulatory regions, thus potentially contributing to regulatory functions of such regions. Here we report numerous sequence fragments that are statistically over-enriched in enhancers and promoters of different mammals (which we refer to as ‘sequence determinants’). Interestingly, the degree of statistical enrichment, which presumably is associated with the degree of regulatory impacts of the specific sequence determinant, was significantly higher for promoter sequence determinants than enhancer sequence determinants. We further used a machine learning method to construct prediction models using sequence determinants. Remarkably, prediction models constructed from one species could be used to predict regulatory regions of other species with high accuracy. This observation indicates that even though the precise locations of regulatory regions diverge rapidly during evolution, the functional potential of sequence determinants underlying regulatory sequences may be conserved between species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Q4TbfATi4e4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Noise propagation in an integrated model of bacterial gene expression and growth</title>

In bacterial cells, gene expression, metabolism, and growth are highly interdependent and tightly coordinated. As a result, stochastic fluctuations in expression levels and instantaneous growth rate show intricate cross-correlations. These correlations are shaped by feedback loops, trade-offs and constraints acting at the cellular level; therefore a quantitative understanding requires an integrated approach. To that end, we here present a mathematical model describing a cell that contains multiple proteins that are each expressed stochastically and jointly limit the growth rate. Conversely, metabolism and growth affect protein synthesis and dilution. Thus, expression noise originating in one gene propagates to metabolism, growth, and the expression of all other genes. Nevertheless, under a small-noise approximation many statistical quantities can be calculated analytically. We identify several routes of noise propagation, illustrate their origins and scaling, and establish important connections between noise propagation and the field of metabolic control analysis. We then present a many-protein model containing &amp;gt;1000 proteins parameterized by previously measured abundance data and demonstrate that the predicted cross-correlations between gene expression and growth rate are in broad agreement with published measurements.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BQy09pr4TN8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Cocaine Exposure Modulates Perineuronal Nets and Synaptic Excitability of Fast-Spiking Interneurons in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that perineuronal nets (PNNs) are required for cocaine-associated memories. Perineuronal nets are extracellular matrix that primarily surrounds parvalbumin (PV)-containing, GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here we measured the impact of acute (1 d) or repeated (5 d) cocaine exposure on PNNs and PV cells within the prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the mPFC. Adult rats were exposed to 1 or 5 d of cocaine and stained for PNNs (using &lt;i&gt;Wisteria floribunda&lt;/i&gt; agglutinin) and PV intensity 2 or 24 h later. In the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC, PNN staining intensity decreased 2 h after 1 d of cocaine exposure but increased after 5 d of cocaine exposure. Cocaine also produced changes in PV intensity, which generally lagged behind that of PNNs. In the prelimbic PFC, both 1 and 5 d of cocaine exposure increased GAD65/67 puncta near PNN-surrounded PV cells, with an increase in the GAD65/67-to-VGluT1 puncta ratio after 5 d of cocaine exposure. In the prelimbic PFC, slice electrophysiology studies in FSIs surrounded by PNNs revealed that both 1 and 5 d of cocaine exposure reduced the number of action potentials 2 h later. Synaptic changes demonstrated that 5 d of cocaine exposure increased the inhibition of FSIs, potentially reducing the inhibition of pyramidal neurons and contributing to their hyperexcitability during relapse behavior. These early and rapid responses to cocaine may alter the network stability of PV FSIs that partially mediate the persistent and chronic nature of drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A framework for the comparison of different EEG acquisition solutions. (arXiv:1810.02107v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02107</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02107</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this work is to propose a framework for the benchmarking of
EEG amplifiers, headsets, and electrodes providing objective recommendation for
a given application. The framework covers: data collection paradigm, data
analysis, and statistical framework. To illustrate, data was collected from 12
different devices totaling up to 6 subjects per device. Two data acquisition
protocols were implemented: a resting-state protocol eyes-open (EO) and
eyes-closed (EC), and an Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) protocol.
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on alpha band (EO/EC) and Event Related Potential
(ERP) were extracted as objective quantification of physiologically meaningful
information. Then, visual representation, univariate statistical analysis, and
multivariate model were performed to increase results interpretability.
Objective criteria show that the spectral SNR in alpha does not provide much
discrimination between systems, suggesting that the acquisition quality might
not be of primary importance for spectral and specifically alpha-based
applications. On the contrary, AEP SNR proved much more variable stressing the
importance of the acquisition setting for ERP experiments. The multivariate
analysis identified some individuals and some systems as independent
statistically significant contributors to the SNR. It highlights the importance
of inter-individual differences in neurophysiological experiments (sample size)
and suggests some device might objectively be superior to others when it comes
to ERP recordings. However, the illustration of the proposed benchmarking
framework suffers from severe limitations including small sample size and sound
card jitter in the auditory stimulations. While these limitations hinders a
definite ranking of the evaluated hardware, we believe the proposed
benchmarking framework to be a modest yet valuable contribution to the field.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider a one-dimensional directional array of diffusively coupled
oscillators. They are perturbed by the injection of a small additive noise,
typically orders of magnitude smaller than the oscillation amplitude, and the
system is studied in a region of the parameters that would yield deterministic
synchronization. Non normal directed couplings seed a coherent amplification of
the perturbation: this latter manifests as a modulation, transversal to the
limit cycle, which gains in potency node after node. If the lattice extends
long enough, the initial synchrony gets eventually lost and the system moves
toward a non trivial attractor, which can be analytically characterized as an
asymptotic splay state. The noise assisted instability, ultimately vehiculated
and amplified by the non normal nature of the imposed couplings, eventually
destabilizes also this second attractor. This phenomenon yields spatiotemporal
patterns, which cannot be anticipated by a conventional linear stability
analysis.

	<description>DLL1 and DLL4 are Notch ligands with high structural similarity but context-dependent functional differences. Here, we analyze their functional divergence using cellular co-culture assays, biochemical studies, and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments. DLL1 and DLL4 activate NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 differently in cell-based assays and this discriminating potential lies in the region between the N-terminus and EGF repeat three. Mice expressing chimeric ligands indicate that the ectodomains dictate ligand function during somitogenesis, and that during myogenesis even regions C-terminal to EGF3 are interchangeable. Substitution of NOTCH1-interface residues in the MNNL and DSL domains of DLL1 with the corresponding amino acids of DLL4, however, does not disrupt DLL1 function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Collectively, our data show that DLL4 preferentially activates NOTCH1 over NOTCH2, whereas DLL1 is equally effective in activating NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, establishing that the ectodomains dictate selective ligand function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and that features outside the known binding interface contribute to their differences.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Multiple serine transposase dimers assemble the transposon-end synaptic complex during IS607-family transposition</title>

	<description>IS&lt;i&gt;607&lt;/i&gt;-family transposons are unusual because they do not have terminal inverted repeats or generate target site duplications. They encode two protein-coding genes, but only &lt;i&gt;tnpA&lt;/i&gt; is required for transposition. Our X-ray structures confirm that TnpA is a member of the serine recombinase (SR) family, but the chemically-inactive quaternary structure of the dimer, along with the N-terminal location of the DNA binding domain, are different from other SRs. TnpA dimers from IS&lt;i&gt;1535&lt;/i&gt; cooperatively associate with multiple subterminal repeats, which together with additional nonspecific binding, form a nucleoprotein filament on one transposon end that efficiently captures a second unbound end to generate the paired-end complex (PEC). Formation of the PEC does not require a change in the dimeric structure of the catalytic domain, but remodeling of the C-terminal α-helical region is involved. We posit that the PEC recruits a chemically-active conformer of TnpA to the transposon end to initiate DNA chemistry.</description>

	<description>Growing evidence suggests that sensory neurons achieve optimal encoding by matching their tuning properties to the natural stimulus statistics. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that feedback pathways from higher brain areas mediate optimized encoding of naturalistic stimuli via temporal whitening in the weakly electric fish &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus leptorhynchus&lt;/i&gt;. While one source of direct feedback uniformly enhances neural responses, a separate source of indirect feedback selectively attenuates responses to low frequencies, thus creating a high-pass neural tuning curve that opposes the decaying spectral power of natural stimuli. Additionally, we recorded from two populations of higher brain neurons responsible for the direct and indirect descending inputs. While one population displayed broadband tuning, the other displayed high-pass tuning and thus performed temporal whitening. Hence, our results demonstrate a novel function for descending input in optimizing neural responses to sensory input through temporal whitening that is likely to be conserved across systems and species.</description>

	<description>Plants produce many different specialized (secondary) metabolites that function in solving ecological challenges; few are known to function in growth or other primary processes. 17-hydroxygeranylinalool diterpene glycosides (DTGs) are abundant herbivory-induced, structurally diverse and commonly malonylated defense metabolites in &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana attenuata&lt;/i&gt; plants. By identifying and silencing a malonyltransferase, &lt;i&gt;NaMaT1, &lt;/i&gt;involved in DTG malonylation, we found that DTG malonylation percentages are normally remarkably uniform, but when disrupted, result in DTG-dependent reduced floral style lengths, which in turn result from reduced stylar cell sizes, IAA contents, and YUC activity; phenotypes that could be restored by IAA supplementation or by silencing the DTG pathway. Moreover, the &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana&lt;/i&gt; genus-specific JA-deficient short-style phenotype also results from alterations in DTG malonylation patterns. Decorations of plant specialized metabolites can be tuned to remarkably uniform levels, and this regulation plays a central but poorly understood role in controlling the development of specific plant parts, such as floral styles.</description>

	<description>Activation of heterotrimeric G proteins is a key step in many signaling cascades. However, a complete mechanism for this process, which requires allosteric communication between binding sites that are ~30 Å apart, remains elusive. We construct an atomically-detailed model of G protein activation by combining three powerful computational methods: metadynamics, Markov state models (MSMs), and CARDS analysis of correlated motions. We uncover a mechanism that is consistent with a wide variety of structural and biochemical data. Surprisingly, the rate-limiting step for GDP release correlates with tilting rather than translation of the GPCR-binding helix 5. β-Strands 1-3 and helix 1 emerge as hubs in the allosteric network that links conformational changes in the GPCR-binding site to disordering of the distal nucleotide-binding site and consequent GDP release. Our approach and insights provide foundations for understanding disease-implicated G protein mutants, illuminating slow events in allosteric networks, and examining unbinding processes with slow off-rates.</description>

	<description>Swi2/Snf2 ATPases remodel protein:DNA complexes in all of the fundamental chromosome‑associated processes. The single‑subunit remodeler Mot1 dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP):DNA complexes and provides a simple model for obtaining structural insights into the action of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases. Previously we reported how the N-terminal domain of Mot1 it binds TBP, NC2 and DNA, but the location of the C-terminal ATPase domain remained unclear (Butryn et al., 2015). Here, we report the crystal structure of the near full-length Mot1 from &lt;i&gt;Chaetomium thermophilum. &lt;/i&gt;Our data show that Mot1 adopts a ring like structure with a catalytically inactive resting state of the ATPase. Biochemical analysis suggests that TBP binding switches Mot1 into an ATP hydrolysis-competent conformation. Combined with our previous results, these data significantly improve the structural model for the complete Mot1:TBP:DNA complex and suggest a general mechanism for Mot1 action.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Efficient Neural Coding in Auditory and Speech Perception</title>

	<description>Speech has long been recognized as ‘special’. Here, we suggest that one of the reasons for speech being special is that our auditory system has evolved to encode it in an efficient, optimal way. The theory of efficient neural coding argues that our perceptual systems have evolved to encode environmental stimuli in the most efficient way. Mathematically, this can be achieved if the optimally efficient codes match the statistics of the signals they represent. Experimental evidence suggests that the auditory code is optimal in this mathematical sense: statistical properties of speech closely match response properties of the cochlea, the auditory nerve, and the auditory cortex.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Accurate registration of 3D time-lapse microscopy images</title>

	<description>In vivo imaging experiments often require automated detection and tracking of changes in the specimen. This problem, however, can be hindered by variations in the position and orientation of the specimen relative to the microscope, as well as by linear and nonlinear deformations. Here, we present a feature-based registration method, coupled with translation, rigid, affine, and B-spline transformations, designed to address these issues in 3D time-lapse microscopy images. In this method, features are detected as local intensity maxima in the source and target image stacks, and their similarity matrix is used as an input to the Hungarian algorithm to establish initial correspondences. Random Sampling Consensus algorithm is then employed to eliminate outliers. The resulting set of corresponding features is used to determine the optimal transformations. Accuracy of the proposed algorithm was tested on fluorescently labeled axons imaged over a 48-day period with a two-photon laser scanning microscope. For this, multiple axons in individual stacks of images were traced semi-manually in 3D, and the distances between the corresponding traces were measured before and after the registration. The results show that there is a progressive improvement in the registration accuracy with increasing complexity of the transformations. In particular, an accuracy of less than 1 voxel (0.26 m) was achieved with a regularized B-spline transformation. To illustrate the utility of the proposed method, registered images were used to automatically track synaptic boutons on axons over the entire duration of the experiment, yielding 99% precision and recall.</description>

	<description>Tree-like neurites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. It is assumed that nurturing affects the structure and function of dendrites, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether mechanosensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use natural mechanical stimulation of the Caenorhabditis elegans' polymodal PVD neurons, induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that animal isolation affects the dendritic tree structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following mechanosensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionary conserved amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our results suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, acting downstream to mechanosensory activation of degenerins.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Decoding voluntary movements and postural tremor based on thalamic LFPs for closed-loop stimulation for essential tremor</title>

	<description>High frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting motor thalamus is an effective therapy for essential tremor (ET). However, conventional continuous stimulation may deliver unnecessary current to the brain since tremor mainly affects voluntary movements and sustained postures in ET. We recorded LFPs from the motor thalamus, surface electromyographic (EMG) signals and/or behavioural measurements in seven ET patients during temporary lead externalization after the first surgery for DBS when they performed different voluntary upper limb movements and in nine more patients during the surgery, when they were asked to lift their arms to trigger postural tremor. We show that both voluntary movements and postural tremor can be decoded based on features extracted from thalamic LFPs using a machine learning based binary classifier. This information can be used to close the loop for DBS so that stimulation could be delivered on demand, without the need for peripheral sensors or additional invasive electrodes.</description>

	<description>We investigated the metabolomics of early cognitive changes related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in order to better understand mechanisms that could contribute to early stages and progression of this disease. This investigation used longitudinal plasma samples from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP), a cohort of participants who were dementia free at enrollment and enriched with a parental history of AD. Metabolomic profiles were quantified for 2,338 fasting plasma samples among 1,206 participants, each with up to three study visits. Of 1,097 metabolites tested, levels of seven were associated with executive function trajectories, including an amino acid and three fatty acids, but none were associated with delayed recall trajectories. Our time-varying metabolomic results suggest potential mechanisms that could contribute to the earliest signs of cognitive decline. In particular, fatty acids may be associated with cognition in a manner that is more complex than previously suspected.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Diffusion Acceleration with Gaussian process Estimated Reconstruction (DAGER)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/436550v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/436550v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Purpose: Image acceleration provides multiple benefits to diffusion MRI (dMRI), with in-plane acceleration reducing distortion and slice-wise acceleration increasing the number of directions that can be acquired in a given scan time. However, as acceleration factors increase, the reconstruction problem becomes ill-conditioned, particularly when using both in-plane acceleration and simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging. In this work, we develop a novel reconstruction method for in-vivo MRI acquisition that provides acceleration beyond what conventional techniques can achieve. Theory and Methods: We propose to constrain the reconstruction in the spatial (k) domain by incorporating information from the angular (q) domain. This approach exploits smoothness of the signal in q-space using Gaussian processes, as has previously been exploited in post-reconstruction analysis. We demonstrate in-plane acceleration exceeding the theoretical parallel imaging limits, and SMS combined with in-plane acceleration at a total factor of 12. This reconstruction is cast within a Bayesian framework that incorporates estimation of smoothness hyper-parameters, with no need for manual tuning. Results: Simulations and in vivo results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method compared with conventional parallel imaging methods. These improvements are achieved without loss of spatial or angular resolution and require only a minor modification to standard pulse sequences. Conclusion: The proposed method provides improvements over existing methods for diffusion acceleration, particularly for high SMS acceleration with in-plane undersampling.</description>

	<description>Over the past few years, the field of visual social cognition and face processing has been dramatically impacted by a series of data-driven studies employing computer-graphics tools to synthesize arbitrary meaningful facial expressions. In the auditory modality, reverse correlation is traditionally used to characterize sensory processing at the level of spectral or spectro-temporal stimulus properties, but not higher-level cognitive processing of e.g. words, sentences or music, by lack of tools able to manipulate the stimulus dimensions that are relevant for these processes. Here, we present an open-source audio-transformation toolbox, called CLEESE, able to systematically randomize the prosody/melody of existing speech and music recordings. CLEESE works by cutting recordings in small successive time segments (e.g. every successive 100 milliseconds in a spoken utterance), and applying a random parametric transformation of each segment's pitch, duration or amplitude, using a new Python-language implementation of the phase-vocoder digital audio technique. We present here two applications of the tool to generate stimuli for studying intonation processing of interrogative vs declarative speech, and rhythm processing of sung melodies.</description>

	<description>The neocortex is capable of modeling complex objects through sensorimotor interaction but the neural mechanisms are poorly understood. Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex represent the location of an animal in its environment, and this location is updated through movement and path integration. In this paper, we propose that grid-like cells in the neocortex represent the location of sensors on an object. We describe a two-layer neural network model that uses cortical grid cells and path integration to robustly learn and recognize objects through movement. Grid cells exhibit regular tiling over environments and are organized into modules, each with its own scale and orientation. A single module encodes position within the spatial scale of the module but is ambiguous over larger spaces. A set of modules can uniquely encode many large spaces. In our model, a layer of cells consisting of several grid-like modules represents a location in the reference frame of a specific object. Another layer of cells which processes sensory input receives this location input as context and uses it to encode the sensory input in the object's reference frame. Sensory input causes the network to invoke previously learned locations that are consistent with the input, and motor input causes the network to update those locations. Simulations show that the model can learn hundreds of objects even when object features alone are insufficient for disambiguation. We discuss the relationship of the model to cortical circuitry and suggest that the reciprocal connections between layers 4 and 6 fit the requirements of the model. We propose that the subgranular layers of cortical columns employ grid cell like mechanisms to represent object specific locations that are updated through movement.</description>

	<description>Recent advances in neuroimaging have allowed the use of network analysis to study the brain in a system-based approach. A system-based analysis of gliomas can shed light on mechanisms underlying neuronal connectivity and plasticity and the recovery process, and it could support surgical decision-making. Surgery has been shifting from image-guided surgery to a functional mapping-guided resection where several structural and functional modalities are used. However, reliable identification of eloquent areas during planning of surgical resection is still a challenge. Pre-operative language mapping performed by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is of great value as it elucidates functional cortical organization, which might be different from patient to patient due to the heterogeneity of the lesions and individual plasticity. In this paper we propose the construction of an &quot;effective&quot; speech network used for surgical decision making. This is achieved by mapping functionally relevant areas identified by nTMS on tractography-based connectomics. Subsequently we compute graph metrics on the identified speech networks of patients who show preoperative aphasia aiming to identify relevant differences between graph metrics in patients with and without preoperative aphasia. Lastly, the validity of the speech networks is examined by checking the involved graph communities.</description>

	<description>Sleep restriction has been proposed to cause impaired emotional processing and emotional regulation by inhibiting top-down control from prefrontal cortex to amygdala. Intentional emotional regulation after sleep restriction has however never been studied using brain imaging. We here aimed to investigate the effect of sleep restriction on emotional regulation through cognitive reappraisal. Forty-seven young (age 20-30) and 33 older (age 65-75) participants (38/23 with complete data and successful sleep intervention) performed a cognitive reappraisal task during fMRI after a night of normal sleep and after restricted sleep (3h). Emotional downregulation was associated with significantly increased activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (pFWE &amp;lt; 0.05) and lateral orbital cortex (pFWE &amp;lt; 0.05) in young, but not in older subjects. Sleep restriction was associated with a decrease in self-reported regulation success to negative stimuli (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and a trend towards perceiving all stimuli as less negative (p = 0.07), in young participants. No effects of sleep restriction on brain activity nor connectivity were found in either age group. In conclusion, our data do not support the idea of a prefrontal-amygdala disconnect after sleep restriction, and neural mechanisms underlying behavioural effects on emotional regulation after insufficient sleep require further investigation.</description>

Many pathological conditions, such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression, are associated with substantial changes in ion concentrations in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. An understanding of the mechanisms that govern ECS concentration dynamics may be a prerequisite for understanding such pathologies. To estimate the transport of ions due to electrodiffusive effects, one must keep track of both the ion concentrations and the electric potential simultaneously in the relevant regions of the brain. Although this is currently unfeasible experimentally, it is in principle achievable with computational models based on biophysical principles and constraints. Previous computational models of extracellular ion-concentration dynamics have required extensive computing power, and therefore have been limited to either phenomena on very small spatiotemporal scales (micrometers and milliseconds), or simplified and idealized 1-dimensional (1-D) transport processes on a larger scale. Here, we present the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, tailored to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales. By assuming electroneutrality, the KNP-framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes on the spatiotemporal scales of nanometers and nanoseconds, and makes it feasible to run simulations on the spatiotemporal scales of millimeters and seconds on a standard desktop computer. In the present work, we use the 3-D KNP framework to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and the electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. In addition to elucidating the single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS, the simulation demonstrates the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework. We envision that future applications of the framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m141eIlY3sI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genomic regions with gene regulatory enhancer activity turnover rapidly across mammals. In contrast, gene expression patterns and transcription factor binding preferences are largely conserved between mammalian species. Based on this conservation, we hypothesized that enhancers active in different mammals would exhibit conserved sequence patterns in spite of their different genomic locations. To investigate this hypothesis, we evaluated the extent to which sequence patterns that are predictive of enhancers in one species are predictive of enhancers in other mammalian species by training and testing two types of machine learning models. We trained support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers to distinguish enhancers defined by histone marks from the genomic background based on DNA sequence patterns in human, macaque, mouse, dog, cow, and opossum. The classifiers accurately identified many adult liver, developing limb, and developing brain enhancers, and the CNNs outperformed the SVMs. Furthermore, classifiers trained in one species and tested in another performed nearly as well as classifiers trained and tested on the same species. We observed similar cross-species conservation when applying the models to human and mouse enhancers validated in transgenic assays. This indicates that many short sequence patterns predictive of enhancers are largely conserved. The sequence patterns most predictive of enhancers in each species matched the binding motifs for a common set of TFs enriched for expression in relevant tissues, supporting the biological relevance of the learned features. Thus, despite the rapid change of active enhancer locations between mammals, cross-species enhancer prediction is often possible. Our results suggest that short sequence patterns encoding enhancer activity have been maintained across more than 180 million years of mammalian evolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b9OpfD0Vd78&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Role of the K+-Cl- co-transporter KCC2a isoform in mammalian respiration at birth</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In central respiratory circuitry, synaptic excitation is responsible for synchronizing neuronal activity in the different respiratory rhythm phases, whereas chloride-mediated inhibition is important for shaping the respiratory pattern itself. The potassium chloride co-transporter KCC2, which serves to maintain low intraneuronal Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and thus render chloride-mediated synaptic signaling inhibitory, exists in two isoforms, KCC2a and KCC2b. KCC2 is essential for functional breathing motor control at birth, but the specific contribution of the KCC2a isoform remains unknown. Here, to address this issue we investigated the respiratory phenotype of mice deficient for KCC2a. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; plethysmographic recordings revealed that KCC2a-deficient pups at P0 transiently express an abnormally low breathing rate and a high occurrence of apneas. Immunostainings confirmed that KCC2a is normally expressed in the brainstem neuronal groups involved in breathing (preBötzinger complex, parafacial respiratory group, hypoglossus nucleus), and is absent in these regions in the KCC2a&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mutant. However, in variously reduced &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; medullary preparations, spontaneous rhythmic respiratory activity is similar to that expressed in wild-type preparations, as is hypoglossal motor output, and no respiratory pauses are detected, suggesting that the rhythm-generating networks are not intrinsically affected in mutants at P0. In contrast, inhibitory neuromodulatory influences exerted by the pons on respiratory rhythmogenesis are stronger in the mutant, thereby explaining the breathing anomalies observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, our results indicate that the KCC2a isoform is important for establishing proper breathing behavior at the time of birth, but by acting at site(s) that are extrinsic to the central respiratory networks themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The expression of the neuronal specific potassium chloride co-transporter KCC2 is necessary for the generation of respiratory activity at birth, but the specific role of the KCC2a isoform in this process remains unknown. By examining &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; the breathing motor output of newborn KCC2a&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice we observed a lower breathing frequency and a high occurrence of apneas at birth. These anomalies, expressed mainly at P0 (day of birth), do not arise from changes in the brainstem respiratory rhythm-generating circuits, but appear to result from abnormally strong inhibitory pontine neuromodulatory influences that target these networks. Our results provide evidence for a transient but important role of the KCC2a isoform in the proper development of the central respiratory command.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Rodents actively whisk their vibrissae, which, when they come in contact with surrounding objects, enables rodents to gather spatial information about the environment. Cortical motor command of whisking is crucial for the control of vibrissa movement. Using awake and head-fixed rats, we investigated the correlations between axonal projection patterns and firing properties in identified layer 5 neurons in the motor cortex, which are associated with vibrissa movement. We found that cortical neurons that sent axons to the brainstem fired preferentially during large-amplitude vibrissae movements and that corticocallosal neurons exhibited a high firing rate during small vibrissa movements or during a quiet state. The differences between these two corticofugal circuits may be related to the mechanisms of motor-associated information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The contents of cortical motor commands and the pathways that they take are two important questions in neuroscience. Previous studies in rodents reported that motor cortex neurons exhibit variable activity patterns during whisking behavior. We combined physiological and morphological analyses of single neurons to provide more detail for understanding the neural circuit related to motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Functional categories of visuomotor neurons in macaque frontal eye field</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Frontal eye field (FEF) in macaque monkeys contributes to visual attention, visual-motor transformations and production of eye movements. Traditionally, neurons in FEF have been classified by the magnitude of increased discharge rates following visual stimulus presentation, during a waiting period, and associated with eye movement production. However, considerable heterogeneity remains within the traditional visual, visuomovement and movement categories. Cluster analysis is a data-driven method of identifying self-segregating groups within a dataset. Because many cluster analysis techniques exist and outcomes vary with analysis assumptions, consensus clustering aggregates over multiple analyses, identifying robust groups. To describe more comprehensively the neuronal composition of FEF, we applied a consensus clustering technique for unsupervised categorization of patterns of spike rate modulation measured during a memory-guided saccade task. We report ten functional categories, expanding on the traditional three. Categories were distinguished by latency, magnitude, and sign of visual response, presence of sustained activity, and dynamics, magnitude and sign of saccade-related modulation. Consensus clustering can include other metrics and can be applied to datasets from other brain regions to provide better information guiding microcircuit models of cortical function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The contribution of a brain region cannot be understood without knowing the diversity, arrangement, and circuitry of constituent neurons. Traditional descriptions of frontal eye field include visual, visuo-saccadic, and saccadic categories. Here, we employ a novel consensus clustering method to identify more reliably functional categories in neural data. While confirming the traditional categories, consensus clustering distinguishes additional, previously unappreciated diversity in neural activity patterns. Such information is necessary to formulate correct microcircuit models of cortical function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Topological exploration of artificial neuronal network dynamics. (arXiv:1810.01747v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the paramount challenges in neuroscience is to understand the dynamics
of individual neurons and how they give rise to network dynamics when
interconnected. Historically, researchers have resorted to graph theory,
statistics, and statistical mechanics to describe the spatiotemporal structure
of such network dynamics. Our novel approach employs tools from algebraic
topology to characterize the global properties of network structure and
dynamics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a method based on persistent homology to automatically classify
network dynamics using topological features of spaces built from various
spike-train distances. We investigate the efficacy of our method by simulating
activity in three small artificial neural networks with different sets of
parameters, giving rise to dynamics that can be classified into four regimes.
We then compute three measures of spike train similarity and use persistent
homology to extract topological features that are fundamentally different from
those used in traditional methods. Our results show that a machine learning
classifier trained on these features can accurately predict the regime of the
network it was trained on and also generalize to other networks that were not
presented during training. Moreover, we demonstrate that using features
extracted from multiple spike-train distances systematically improves the
performance of our method.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: PhoneMD: Learning to Diagnose Parkinson's Disease from Smartphone Data. (arXiv:1810.01485v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that can affect a person's
movement, speech, dexterity, and cognition. Physicians primarily diagnose
Parkinson's disease by performing a clinical assessment of symptoms. However,
misdiagnoses are common. One factor that contributes to misdiagnoses is that
the symptoms of Parkinson's disease may not be prominent at the time the
clinical assessment is performed. Here, we present a machine-learning approach
towards distinguishing between healthy people and people with Parkinson's
disease using long-term data collected from smartphone-based tests, including
walking, voice, tapping and memory tests. We demonstrate that the presented
approach leads to significant performance improvements over existing methods
(area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.85) in data from a
cohort of 1853 participants. Our results confirm that smartphone data collected
over extended periods of time could in the future potentially be used as
additional evidence for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A plant chitinase controls cortical infection thread progression and nitrogen-fixing symbiosis</title>

	<description>Morphogens provide positional information and their concentration is key to the organized development of multicellular organisms. Nitrogen-fixing root nodules are unique organs induced by Nod factor-producing bacteria. Localized production of Nod factors establishes a developmental field within the root where plant cells are reprogrammed to form infection threads and primordia. We found that regulation of Nod factor levels by &lt;i&gt;Lotus japonicus&lt;/i&gt; is required for the formation of nitrogen-fixing organs, determining the fate of this induced developmental program. Our analysis of plant and bacterial mutants shows that a host chitinase modulates Nod factor levels possibly in a structure-dependent manner. In &lt;i&gt;Lotus&lt;/i&gt;, this is required for maintaining Nod factor signalling in parallel with the elongation of infection threads within the nodule cortex, while root hair infection and primordia formation are not influenced. Our study shows that infected nodules require balanced levels of Nod factors for completing their transition to functional, nitrogen-fixing organs.</description>

	<description>A major aspect of the regulatory function of mast cells appears to be their role as intermediaries between the nervous and immune systems. Mast cells are activated by neurotransmitters allowing neural control of innate and adaptive immunity. Conversely, mast cells secrete mediators including neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors that directly influence nerves, causing acute activation and/or long-lasting changes in excitability and phenotype. While some basic mechanisms underlying mast cell–nerve communication are well-established, the full extent to which this relationship influences health and disease is unclear.</description>

Biologists and environmental scientists now routinely solve computational problems that were unimaginable a generation ago. Examples include processing geospatial data, analyzing -omics data, and running large-scale simulations. Conventional desktop computing cannot handle these tasks when they are large, and high-performance computing is not always available nor the most appropriate solution for all computationally intense problems. High-throughput computing (HTC) is one method for handling computationally intense research. In contrast to high-performance computing, which uses a single &quot;supercomputer,&quot; HTC can distribute tasks over many computers (e.g., idle desktop computers, dedicated servers, or cloud-based resources). HTC facilities exist at many academic and government institutes and are relatively easy to create from commodity hardware. Additionally, consortia such as Open Science Grid facilitate HTC, and commercial entities sell cloud-based solutions for researchers who lack HTC at their institution. We provide an introduction to HTC for biologists and environmental scientists. Our examples from biology and the environmental sciences use HTCondor, an open source HTC system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dyQK2MYcEVQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Suppressing Interferon-{gamma} Stimulates Microglial Responses and Repair of Microbleeds in the Diabetic Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8707?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microcirculatory damage is a common complication for those with vascular risk factors, such as diabetes. To resolve vascular insults, the brain's immune cells (microglia) must rapidly envelop the site of injury. Currently, it is unknown whether Type 1 diabetes, a condition associated with chronic immune system dysfunction, alters microglial responses to damage and what mechanisms are responsible. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon microscopy in adult male mice, we show that microglial envelopment of laser-induced cerebral microbleeds is diminished in a hyperglycemic mouse model of Type 1 diabetes, which could not be fully rescued with chronic insulin treatment. Microglia were important for vessel repair because reduced microglial accumulation in diabetic mice or near-complete depletion in healthy controls was associated with greater secondary leakage of the damaged vessel. Broadly suppressing inflammation with dexamethasone in diabetic mice but not healthy controls, significantly enhanced microglial responses to microbleeds and attenuated secondary vessel leakage. These enhancements were associated with changes in IFN- signaling because dexamethasone suppressed abnormally high levels of IFN- protein levels in brain and blood serum of diabetic mice. Further, blocking IFN- in diabetic mice with neutralizing antibodies restored normal microglial chemotaxic responses and purinoceptor &lt;i&gt;P2ry12&lt;/i&gt; gene expression, as well as mitigated secondary leakage. These results suggest that abnormal IFN- signaling disrupts microglial function in the diabetic brain, and that immunotherapies targeting IFN- can stimulate microglial repair of damaged vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although Type 1 diabetes is an established risk factor for vascular complications, such as microbleeds, and is known to hinder wound healing in the body, no study has examined how diabetes impacts the brain's innate immune reparative response (involving cells called microglia) to vascular injury. Here we show that microglial responses to brain microbleeds were diminished in diabetic animals, which also exacerbated secondary leakage from damaged vessels. These impairments were related to abnormally high levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN- because reducing IFN- with immunosuppressant drugs or blocking antibodies helped restore normal microglial responses and repair of damaged vessels. These data highlight the use of IFN- modulating therapeutics to enhance vascular repair in at-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Eye-Movement Intervention Enhances Extinction via Amygdala Deactivation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8694?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8694?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Improving extinction learning is essential to optimize psychotherapy for persistent fear-related disorders. In two independent studies (both &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 24), we found that goal-directed eye movements activate a dorsal frontoparietal network and transiently deactivate the amygdala (&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17). Connectivity analyses revealed that this downregulation potentially engages a ventromedial prefrontal pathway known to be involved in cognitive regulation of emotion. Critically, when eye movements followed memory reactivation during extinction learning, it reduced spontaneous fear recovery 24 h later (&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.21). Stronger amygdala deactivation furthermore predicted a stronger reduction in subsequent fear recovery after reinstatement (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.39). In conclusion, we show that extinction learning can be improved with a noninvasive eye-movement intervention that triggers a transient suppression of the amygdala. Our finding that another task which taxes working memory leads to a similar amygdala suppression furthermore indicates that this effect is likely not specific to eye movements, which is in line with a large body of behavioral studies. This study contributes to the understanding of a widely used treatment for traumatic symptoms by providing a parsimonious account for how working-memory tasks and goal-directed eye movements can enhance extinction-based psychotherapy, namely through neural circuits (e.g., amygdala deactivation) similar to those that support cognitive control of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fear-related disorders represent a significant burden on individual sufferers and society. There is a high need to optimize treatment, in particular via noninvasive means. One potentially effective intervention is execution of eye movements following trauma recall. However, a neurobiological understanding of how eye movements reduce traumatic symptoms is lacking. We demonstrate that goal-directed eye-movements, like working-memory tasks, deactivate the amygdala, the core neural substrate of fear learning. Effective connectivity analyses revealed amygdala deactivation potentially engaged dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal pathways. When applied during safety learning, this deactivation predicts a reduction in later fear recovery. These findings provide a parsimonious and mechanistic account of how behavioral manipulations taxing working memory and suppressing amygdala activity can alter retention of emotional memories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Not All Predictions Are Equal: &quot;What&quot; and &quot;When&quot; Predictions Modulate Activity in Auditory Cortex through Different Mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8680?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8680?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Using predictions based on environmental regularities is fundamental for adaptive behavior. While it is widely accepted that predictions across different stimulus attributes (e.g., time and content) facilitate sensory processing, it is unknown whether predictions across these attributes rely on the same neural mechanism. Here, to elucidate the neural mechanisms of predictions, we combine invasive electrophysiological recordings (human electrocorticography in 4 females and 2 males) with computational modeling while manipulating predictions about content (&quot;what&quot;) and time (&quot;when&quot;). We found that &quot;when&quot; predictions increased evoked activity over motor and prefrontal regions both at early (~180 ms) and late (430–450 ms) latencies. &quot;What&quot; predictability, however, increased evoked activity only over prefrontal areas late in time (420–460 ms). Beyond these dissociable influences, we found that &quot;what&quot; and &quot;when&quot; predictability interactively modulated the amplitude of early (165 ms) evoked responses in the superior temporal gyrus. We modeled the observed neural responses using biophysically realistic neural mass models, to better understand whether &quot;what&quot; and &quot;when&quot; predictions tap into similar or different neurophysiological mechanisms. Our modeling results suggest that &quot;what&quot; and &quot;when&quot; predictability rely on complementary neural processes: &quot;what&quot; predictions increased short-term plasticity in auditory areas, whereas &quot;when&quot; predictability increased synaptic gain in motor areas. Thus, content and temporal predictions engage complementary neural mechanisms in different regions, suggesting domain-specific prediction signaling along the cortical hierarchy. Encoding predictions through different mechanisms may endow the brain with the flexibility to efficiently signal different sources of predictions, weight them by their reliability, and allow for their encoding without mutual interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Predictions of different stimulus features facilitate sensory processing. However, it is unclear whether predictions of different attributes rely on similar or different neural mechanisms. By combining invasive electrophysiological recordings of cortical activity with experimental manipulations of participants' predictions about content and time of acoustic events, we found that the two types of predictions had dissociable influences on cortical activity, both in terms of the regions involved and the timing of the observed effects. Further, our biophysical modeling analysis suggests that predictability of content and time rely on complementary neural processes: short-term plasticity in auditory areas and synaptic gain in motor areas, respectively. This suggests that predictions of different features are encoded with complementary neural mechanisms in different brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Lifespan Trajectory of the Encoding-Retrieval Flip: A Multimodal Examination of Medial Parietal Cortex Contributions to Episodic Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8666?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8666?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The formation of episodic memories is associated with deactivation during encoding and activation during retrieval in the posteromedial cortex (PMC). We hypothesized that the encoding/retrieval (E/R) flip is a critical component of episodic memory across the lifespan because structural and metabolic changes in the PMC coincide with the fine tuning of the episodic memory system in development and the reductions of memory performance in aging. The aims of the present study were, first, to describe lifespan trajectories of PMC encoding and retrieval activity in 270 human participants (167 females) from 6 to 80 years of age. Our second goal was to construct a model for episodic memory development in which contributions from brain activity, cortical thickness (CT), and structural connectivity are accounted for. We found that modulation of neural activity in response to memory encoding and retrieval demands was not fully developed until adolescence and decreased from adulthood through old age. The magnitude of the E/R flip was related to source memory and 55% of the age-related variance in source memory performance during childhood and adolescence could be accounted for by the E/R flip, CT, and mean diffusivity together. However, only CT and the E/R flip provided unique contributions with which to explain memory performance. The results suggest that neural dynamics in the PMC is related to the development of episodic memory during childhood and adolescence. The similar trajectories of the E/R flip and episodic memory emergence and decline through development and aging further suggests that a lifelong relationship exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Modulation of neural activity in the posteromedial cortex (PMC) in response to memory encoding/retrieval (E/R) demands (E/R flip) does not reach its peak until adolescence and decreases from adulthood through old age. The magnitude of the E/R flip is related to source memory and 55% of the age-related variance in source memory performance during childhood and adolescence can be accounted for by the E/R flip and brain structure together. The results suggest that neural dynamics in the PMC is related to the development of episodic memory function during childhood and adolescence and the similar trajectories of the E/R flip and episodic memory performance through development and aging suggests that a lifelong relationship exists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Postnatal Restriction of Activity-Induced Ca2+ Responses to Schwann Cells at the Neuromuscular Junction Are Caused by the Proximo-Distal Loss of Axonal Synaptic Vesicles during Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8650?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Terminal or perisynaptic Schwann cells (TPSCs) are nonmyelinating, perisynaptic glial cells at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) that respond to neural activity by increasing intracellular calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and regulate synaptic function. The onset of activity-induced TPSC Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses, as well as whether axonal Schwann cells (ASCs) along the nerve respond to nerve stimulation during development, is unknown. Here, we show that phrenic nerve stimulation in developing male and female mice elicited Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses in both ASCs and TPSCs at embryonic day 14. ASC responses were lost in a proximo-distal gradient over time, but could continue to be elicited by bath application of neurotransmitter, suggesting that a loss of release rather than a change in ASC competence accounted for this response gradient. Similar to those of early postnatal TPSCs, developing ASC/TPSC responses were mediated by purinergic P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. The loss of ASC Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses was correlated to the proximo-distal disappearance of synaptophysin immunoreactivity and synaptic vesicles in phrenic axons. Accordingly, developing ASC Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses were blocked by botulinum toxin. Interestingly, the loss of ASC Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses was also correlated to the proximo-distal development of myelination. Finally, compared with postnatal TPSCs, neonatal TPSCs and ASCs displayed Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in response to lower frequencies and shorter durations of nerve stimulation. Together, these results with GCaMP3-expressing Schwann cells provide &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; evidence that both axons and presynaptic terminals initially exhibit activity-induced vesicular release of neurotransmitter, but that the subsequent loss of axonal synaptic vesicles accounts for the postnatal restriction of vesicular release to the NMJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neural activity regulates multiple aspects of development, including myelination. Whether the excitation of developing neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; results in the release of neurotransmitter from both axons and presynaptic terminals is unclear. Here, using mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP3 in Schwann cells, we show that both terminal/perisynaptic Schwann cells at the diaphragm neuromuscular junction and axonal Schwann cells along the phrenic nerve exhibit activity-induced calcium responses early in development, mediated by the vesicular release of ATP from the axons of motor neurons acting on P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. These &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; findings corroborate classic &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies demonstrating transmitter release by developing axons, and thus represent a tool to study the mechanisms and significance of this process during embryonic development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Having More Choices Changes How Human Observers Weight Stable Sensory Evidence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8635?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decision-making becomes slower when more choices are available. Existing models attribute this slowing to poor sensory processing, to attenuated rates of sensory evidence accumulation, or to increases in the amount of evidence required before committing to a decision (a higher decision threshold). However, studies have not isolated the effects of having more choices on sensory and decision-related processes from changes in task difficulty and divided attention. Here, we controlled task difficulty while independently manipulating the distribution of attention and the number of choices available to male and female human observers. We used EEG to measure steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and a frontal late positive deflection (LPD), EEG markers of sensory and postsensory decision-related processes, respectively. We found that dividing attention decreased SSVEP and LPD amplitudes, consistent with dampened sensory responses and slower rates of evidence accumulation, respectively. In contrast, having more choices did not alter SSVEP amplitude and led to a larger LPD. These results suggest that having more options largely spares early sensory processing and slows down decision-making via a selective increase in decision thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When more choices are available, decision-making becomes slower. We tested whether this phenomenon is due to poor sensory processing, to reduced rates of evidence accumulation, or to increases in the amount of evidence required before committing to a decision (a higher decision threshold). We measured choice modulations of sensory and decision-related neural responses using EEG. We also minimized potential confounds from changes in the distribution of attention and task difficulty, which often covary with having more choices. Dividing attention reduced the activity levels of both sensory and decision-related responses. However, having more choices did not change sensory processing and led to larger decision-related responses. These results suggest that having more choices spares sensory processing and selectively increases decision thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Rhythm and Synchrony in a Cortical Network Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We studied mechanisms for cortical gamma-band activity in the cerebral cortex and identified neurobiological factors that affect such activity. This was done by analyzing the behavior of a previously developed, data-driven, large-scale network model that simulated many visual functions of monkey V1 cortex (Chariker et al., 2016). Gamma activity was an emergent property of the model. The model's gamma activity, like that of the real cortex, was (1) episodic, (2) variable in frequency and phase, and (3) graded in power with stimulus variables like orientation. The spike firing of the model's neuronal population was only partially synchronous during multiple firing events (MFEs) that occurred at gamma rates. Detailed analysis of the model's MFEs showed that gamma-band activity was multidimensional in its sources. Most spikes were evoked by excitatory inputs. A large fraction of these inputs came from recurrent excitation within the local circuit, but feedforward and feedback excitation also contributed, either through direct pulsing or by raising the overall baseline. Inhibition was responsible for ending MFEs, but disinhibition led directly to only a small minority of the synchronized spikes. As a potential explanation for the wide range of gamma characteristics observed in different parts of cortex, we found that the relative rise times of AMPA and GABA synaptic conductances have a strong effect on the degree of synchrony in gamma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Canonical computations used throughout the cerebral cortex are performed in primary visual cortex (V1). Providing theoretical mechanisms for these computations will advance understanding of computation throughout cortex. We studied one dynamical feature, gamma-band rhythms, in a large-scale, data-driven, computational model of monkey V1. Our most significant conclusion is that the sources of gamma band activity are multidimensional. A second major finding is that the relative rise times of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials have strong effects on spike synchrony and peak gamma band power. Insight gained from studying our V1 model can shed light on the functions of other cortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Critical Role for Sorting Nexin 1 in the Trafficking of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8605?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) function as modulators of neuronal physiology and they have also been implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Trafficking of mGluRs plays important roles in controlling the precise localization of these receptors at specific region of the cell, as well as it regulates the activity of these receptors. Despite this obvious significance, we know very little about the cellular machineries that control the trafficking of these receptors in the CNS. Sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) has been shown to regulate the endosomal sorting of few cell surface receptors either to lysosomes where they are downregulated or back to the cell surface. Using &quot;molecular replacement&quot; approach in hippocampal neurons derived from mice of both sexes, we show here that SNX1 plays critical role in the trafficking of mGluR1, a member of the group I mGluR family. Overexpression of dominant-negative SNX1 or knockdown of endogenous SNX1 resulted in the rapid recycling of the receptor. Importantly, recycling via the rapid recycling route, did not allow the resensitization of the receptors. Our data suggest that both, N-terminal and C-terminal region of SNX1 play critical role in the normal trafficking of the receptor. In addition, we also show here that SNX1 regulates the trafficking of mGluR1 through the interaction with Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate), a protein that has been implicated in both signaling and vesicular trafficking. Thus, these studies reveal a mechanistic role of SNX1 in the trafficking of group I mGluRs and its physiological implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Group I mGluRs are activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate in the CNS, and play various important roles in the brain. Similar to many other receptors, trafficking plays crucial roles in controlling the precise localization as well as activity of these receptors. Despite this obvious significance very little is known about the cellular machineries that control the trafficking of these receptors. We demonstrate here, that SNX1 plays a critical role in the trafficking of mGluR1, a member of the group I mGluR family. SNX1-mediated trafficking is critical for the resensitization of the receptor. SNX1 controls the trafficking of the receptor through the interaction with another protein, Hrs. The results suggest a role for SNX1 in the regulation of group I mGluRs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Altered Auditory Processing, Filtering, and Reactivity in the Cntnap2 Knock-Out Rat Model for Neurodevelopmental Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8588?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory processing, and auditory processing in particular, is altered in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The typical maturation of the auditory system is perturbed in these individuals during early development, which may underlie altered auditory reactivity that persists in later life. Of the many genes that regulate the auditory system development, loss-of-function mutations in the &lt;i&gt;CNTNAP2&lt;/i&gt; gene are strongly associated with language processing deficits and ASD. Therefore, using a novel &lt;i&gt;Cntnap2&lt;/i&gt; knock-out rat model, we tested the impact of &lt;i&gt;Cntnap2&lt;/i&gt; loss on auditory processing, filtering, and reactivity throughout development and young adulthood in male and female animals. Although hearing thresholds were not altered in &lt;i&gt;Cntnap2&lt;/i&gt; knock-out animals, we found a reduction in response amplitudes and a delay in response latency of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in juvenile &lt;i&gt;Cntnap2&lt;/i&gt; knock-out rats compared with age-matched controls. Amplitudes and latency of the ABR largely normalized by adulthood, indicating a delayed maturation of auditory processing pathways in &lt;i&gt;Cntnap2&lt;/i&gt; knock-out rats. Despite the reduced ABR amplitudes, adolescent &lt;i&gt;Cntnap2&lt;/i&gt; knock-out animals displayed increased startle reactivity accompanied by disruptions in sensory filtering and sensorimotor gating across various conditions, most of which persisted in adulthood. All of these observations show striking parallels to disruptions reported in ASD. Our results also imply that developmental disruptions of sensory signal processing are associated with persistent changes in neural circuitries responsible for implicit auditory evoked behavior, emphasizing the need for interventions that target sensory processing disruptions early during development in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This is the first study of brainstem auditory processing in a novel knock-out rat model with very high construct and face validity for autism spectrum disorders. Electrophysiological and behavioral measures of implicit auditory-evoked responses were systematically taken across developmental stages. Auditory processing, filtering, and reactivity disruptions show striking similarities to observations in autism. We also show for the first time that, whereas auditory brainstem responses normalize by adulthood, disruptions in brainstem-mediated auditory-evoked behavior persist. This indicates that early developmental perturbations in sensory processing can cause permanent maladaptive changes in circuitries responsible for auditory reactivity, underlining the importance for interventions early during development aiming at normalizing sensory processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Active Sound Localization Sharpens Spatial Tuning in Human Primary Auditory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8574?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8574?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spatial hearing sensitivity in humans is dynamic and task-dependent, but the mechanisms in human auditory cortex that enable dynamic sound location encoding remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed how active behavior affects encoding of sound location (azimuth) in primary auditory cortical areas and planum temporale (PT). According to the hierarchical model of auditory processing and cortical functional specialization, PT is implicated in sound location (&quot;where&quot;) processing. Yet, our results show that spatial tuning profiles in primary auditory cortical areas (left primary core and right caudo-medial belt) sharpened during a sound localization (&quot;where&quot;) task compared with a sound identification (&quot;what&quot;) task. In contrast, spatial tuning in PT was sharp but did not vary with task performance. We further applied a population pattern decoder to the measured fMRI activity patterns, which confirmed the task-dependent effects in the left core: sound location estimates from fMRI patterns measured during active sound localization were most accurate. In PT, decoding accuracy was not modulated by task performance. These results indicate that changes of population activity in human primary auditory areas reflect dynamic and task-dependent processing of sound location. As such, our findings suggest that the hierarchical model of auditory processing may need to be revised to include an interaction between primary and functionally specialized areas depending on behavioral requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; According to a purely hierarchical view, cortical auditory processing consists of a series of analysis stages from sensory (acoustic) processing in primary auditory cortex to specialized processing in higher-order areas. Posterior-dorsal cortical auditory areas, planum temporale (PT) in humans, are considered to be functionally specialized for spatial processing. However, this model is based mostly on passive listening studies. Our results provide compelling evidence that active behavior (sound localization) sharpens spatial selectivity in primary auditory cortex, whereas spatial tuning in functionally specialized areas (PT) is narrow but task-invariant. These findings suggest that the hierarchical view of cortical functional specialization needs to be extended: our data indicate that active behavior involves feedback projections from higher-order regions to primary auditory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Across Species &quot;Natural Ablation&quot; Reveals the Brainstem Source of a Noninvasive Biomarker of Binaural Hearing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8563?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The binaural interaction component (BIC) of the auditory brainstem response is a noninvasive electroencephalographic signature of neural processing of binaural sounds. Despite its potential as a clinical biomarker, the neural structures and mechanism that generate the BIC are not known. We explore here the hypothesis that the BIC emerges from excitatory–inhibitory interactions in auditory brainstem neurons. We measured the BIC in response to click stimuli while varying interaural time differences (ITDs) in subjects of either sex from five animal species. Species had head sizes spanning a 3.5-fold range and correspondingly large variations in the sizes of the auditory brainstem nuclei known to process binaural sounds [the medial superior olive (MSO) and the lateral superior olive (LSO)]. The BIC was reliably elicited in all species, including those that have small or inexistent MSOs. In addition, the range of ITDs where BIC was elicited was independent of animal species, suggesting that the BIC is not a reflection of the processing of ITDs per se. Finally, we provide a model of the amplitude and latency of the BIC peak, which is based on excitatory–inhibitory synaptic interactions, without assuming any specific arrangement of delay lines. Our results show that the BIC is preserved across species ranging from mice to humans. We argue that this is the result of generic excitatory–inhibitory synaptic interactions at the level of the LSO, and thus best seen as reflecting the integration of binaural inputs as opposed to their spatial properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Noninvasive electrophysiological measures of sensory system activity are critical for the objective clinical diagnosis of human sensory processing deficits. The binaural component of sound-evoked auditory brainstem responses is one such measure of binaural auditory coding fidelity in the early stages of the auditory system. Yet, the precise neurons that lead to this evoked potential are not fully understood. This paper provides a comparative study of this potential in different mammals and shows that it is preserved across species, from mice to men, despite large variations in morphology and neuroanatomy. Our results confirm its relevance to the assessment of binaural hearing integrity in humans and demonstrates how it can be used to bridge the gap between rodent models and humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Co-Modulation Rules of Synapses and Voltage-Gated Currents Coordinate Interactions of Multiple Neuromodulators</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple neuromodulators act in concert to shape the properties of neural circuits. Different neuromodulators usually activate distinct receptors but can have overlapping targets. Therefore, circuit output depends on neuromodulator interactions at shared targets, a poorly understood process. We explored quantitative rules of co-modulation of two principal targets of neuromodulation: synapses and voltage-gated ionic currents. In the stomatogastric ganglion of the male crab &lt;i&gt;Cancer borealis&lt;/i&gt;, the neuropeptides proctolin (Proc) and the crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) modulate synapses of the pyloric circuit and activate a voltage-gated current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;MI&lt;/sub&gt;) in multiple neurons. We examined the validity of a simple dose-dependent quantitative rule, that co-modulation by Proc and CCAP is predicted by the linear sum of the individual effects of each modulator up to saturation. We found that this rule is valid for co-modulation of synapses, but not for the activation of &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;MI&lt;/sub&gt;, in which co-modulation was sublinear. The predictions for the co-modulation of &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;MI&lt;/sub&gt; activation were greatly improved if we assumed that the intracellular pathways activated by two peptide receptors inhibit one another. These findings suggest that the pathways activated by two neuromodulators could have distinct interactions, leading to distinct co-modulation rules for different targets even in the same neuron. Given the evolutionary conservation of neuromodulator receptors and signaling pathways, such distinct rules for co-modulation of different targets are likely to be common across neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We examine the quantitative rules of co-modulation at multiple shared targets, the first such characterization to our knowledge. Our results show that dose-dependent co-modulation of distinct targets in the same cells by the same two neuromodulators follows different rules: co-modulation of synaptic currents is linearly additive up to saturation, whereas co-modulation of the voltage-gated ionic current targeted in a single neuron is nonlinear, a mechanism that is likely generalizable. Given that all neural systems are multiply modulated and neuromodulators often act on shared targets, these findings and the methodology could guide studies to examine dynamic actions of neuromodulators at the biophysical and systems level in sensory and motor functions, sleep/wake regulation, and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Retrospective Cues Mitigate Information Loss in Human Cortex during Working Memory Storage</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) enables the flexible representation of information over short intervals. It is well established that WM performance can be enhanced by a retrospective cue presented during storage, yet the neural mechanisms responsible for this benefit are unclear. Here, we tested several explanations for retrospective cue benefits by quantifying changes in spatial WM representations reconstructed from alpha-band (8–12 Hz) EEG activity recorded from human participants (both sexes) before and after the presentation of a retrospective cue. This allowed us to track cue-related changes in WM representations with high temporal resolution (tens of milliseconds). Participants encoded the locations of two colored discs for subsequent report. During neutral trials, an uninformative cue instructed participants to remember the locations of both discs across a blank delay, and we observed a monotonic decrease in the fidelity of reconstructed spatial WM representations with time. During valid trials, a 100% reliable cue indicated that the color of the disc participants would be probed to report. Critically, valid cues were presented immediately after the termination of the encoding display [&quot;valid early&quot; (VE) trials] or midway through the delay period [&quot;valid late&quot; (VL) trials]. During VE trials, the gradual loss of location-specific information observed during neutral trials was eliminated, while during VL trials it was partially reversed. Our findings suggest that retrospective cues engage several different mechanisms that together serve to mitigate information loss during WM storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Working memory (WM) performance can be improved by a cue presented during storage. This effect, termed a retrospective cue benefit, has been used to explore the limitations of attentional prioritization in WM. However, the mechanisms responsible for retrospective cue benefits are unclear. Here we tested several explanations for retrospective cue benefits by examining how they influence WM representations reconstructed from human EEG activity. This approach allowed us to visualize, quantify, and track the effects of retrospective cues with high temporal resolution (on the order of tens of milliseconds). We show that under different circumstances retrospective cues can both eliminate and even partially reverse information loss during WM storage, suggesting that retrospective cue benefits have manifold origins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain actively represents incoming information, but these representations are only useful to the extent that they flexibly reflect changes in the environment. How does the brain transform representations across changes, such as in size or viewing angle? We conducted a fMRI experiment and a magnetoencephalography experiment in humans (both sexes) in which participants viewed objects before and after affine viewpoint changes (rotation, translation, enlargement). We used a novel approach, representational transformation analysis, to derive transformation functions that linked the distributed patterns of brain activity evoked by an object before and after an affine change. Crucially, transformations derived from one object could predict a postchange representation for novel objects. These results provide evidence of general operations in the brain that are distinct from neural representations evoked by particular objects and scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The dominant focus in cognitive neuroscience has been on how the brain represents information, but these representations are only useful to the extent that they flexibly reflect changes in the environment. How does the brain transform representations, such as linking two states of an object, for example, before and after an object undergoes a physical change? We used a novel method to derive transformations between the brain activity evoked by an object before and after an affine viewpoint change. We show that transformations derived from one object undergoing a change generalized to a novel object undergoing the same change. This result shows that there are general perceptual operations that transform object representations from one state to another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cholecystokinin Switches the Plasticity of GABA Synapses in the Dorsomedial Hypothalamus via Astrocytic ATP Release</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/40/8515?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Whether synapses in appetite-regulatory brain regions undergo long-term changes in strength in response to satiety peptides is poorly understood. Here we show that following bursts of afferent activity, the neuromodulator and satiety peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) shifts the plasticity of GABA synapses in the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus of male Sprague Dawley rats from long-term depression to long-term potentiation (LTP). This LTP requires the activation of both type 2 CCK receptors and group 5 metabotropic glutamate receptors, resulting in a rise in astrocytic intracellular calcium and subsequent ATP release. ATP then acts on presynaptic P2X receptors to trigger a prolonged increase in GABA release. Our observations demonstrate a novel form of CCK-mediated plasticity that requires astrocytic ATP release, and could serve as a mechanism for appetite regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Satiety peptides, like cholecystokinin, play an important role in the central regulation of appetite, but their effect on synaptic plasticity is not well understood. The current data provide novel evidence that cholecystokinin shifts the plasticity from long-term depression to long-term potentiation at GABA synapses in the rat dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. We also demonstrate that this plasticity requires the concerted action of cholecystokinin and glutamate on astrocytes, triggering the release of the gliotransmitter ATP, which subsequently increases GABA release from neighboring inhibitory terminals. This research reveals a novel neuropeptide-induced switch in the direction of synaptic plasticity that requires astrocytes, and could represent a new mechanism by which cholecystokinin regulates appetite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Fast-rising sensory events evoke a series of functionally heterogeneous event-related potentials (ERPs). Stimulus repetition at 1 Hz induces a strong habituation of the largest ERP responses, the vertex waves (VWs). VWs are elicited by stimuli regardless of their modality, provided that they are salient and behaviorally relevant. In contrast, the effect of stimulus repetition on the earlier sensory components of ERPs has been less explored, and the few existing results are inconsistent. To characterize how the different ERP waves habituate over time, we recorded the responses elicited by 60 identical somatosensory stimuli (activating either non-nociceptive Aβ or nociceptive A afferents), delivered at 1 Hz to healthy human participants. We show that the well-described spatiotemporal sequence of lateralized and vertex ERP components elicited by the first stimulus of the series is largely preserved in the smaller-amplitude, habituated response elicited by the last stimuli of the series. We also found that the earlier lateralized sensory wave habituates across the 60 trials following the same decay function of the VWs: this decay function is characterized by a large drop at the first stimulus repetition followed by smaller decreases at subsequent repetitions. Interestingly, the same decay functions described the habituation of ERPs elicited by repeated non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli. This study provides a neurophysiological characterization of the effect of prolonged and repeated stimulation on the main components of somatosensory ERPs. It also demonstrates that both lateralized waves and VWs are obligatory components of ERPs elicited by non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Note on the Estimation of Embedded Hermitian Gaussian Graphical Models for MEEG Source Activity and Connectivity Analysis in the Frequency Domain. Part I: Single Frequency Component and Subject. (arXiv:1810.01174v1 [stat.ME])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This technical note presents an inference framework for hierarchically
conditioned (embedded) Hermitian Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM). Our
methodology, although extendible to several GGMs applications, is mainly
centered on the specific neuroscientific context encompassing the estimation of
brain sources activity and connectivity from Magnetoencephalography or
Electroencephalography (MEEG) signals. This will be conceived in a series of
papers with two parts. Part I: Analysis of a single frequency component from a
single subject. Part II: Analysis of the Cross-Spectra for multiple subjects in
a population. The strategy is based on Maximum Posterior Analysis, via the
Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, of the Hermitian GGMs Parameters and
Hyperparameters. The Hyperparameters set, which comprises MEEG signal noise
covariance and source precision (connectivity) matrices of the MEEG generative
model, is informed with Priors of special interest in the field and whose
implementation in GGM estimation still poses a technical challenge. The theory
presented here encapsulates two essential contributions. First: The formulation
of a target function for the connectivity estimator that resembles an effective
GGM of source activity, which is merged to the maximization step of the
iterative EM strategy. Second: A new procedure for the estimation of the source
activity effective GGM. These theoretical contributions provide for an explicit
and highly optimal connectivity estimation procedure.

	<description>Bcl-2 family proteins reorganize mitochondrial membranes during apoptosis, to form pores and rearrange cristae. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; analysis integrated with human genetics reveals a novel homeostatic mitochondrial function for Bcl-2 family protein Bid. Loss of full-length Bid results in apoptosis-independent, irregular cristae with decreased respiration. &lt;i&gt;Bid-/-&lt;/i&gt; mice display stress-induced myocardial dysfunction and damage. A gene-based approach applied to a biobank, validated in two independent GWAS studies, reveals that decreased genetically determined BID expression associates with myocardial infarction (MI) susceptibility. Patients in the bottom 5% of the expression distribution exhibit &amp;gt;4 fold increased MI risk. Carrier status with nonsynonymous variation in Bid's membrane binding domain, Bid&lt;sup&gt;M148T&lt;/sup&gt;, associates with MI predisposition. Furthermore, Bid but not Bid&lt;sup&gt;M148T&lt;/sup&gt; associates with Mcl-1&lt;sup&gt;Matrix&lt;/sup&gt;, previously implicated in cristae stability; decreased MCL-1 expression associates with MI. Our results identify a role for Bid in homeostatic mitochondrial cristae reorganization, that we link to human cardiac disease.</description>

	<description>HAP2 is a class II gamete fusogen in many eukaryotic kingdoms. A crystal structure of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas&lt;/i&gt; HAP2 shows a trimeric fusion state. Domains D1, D2.1 and D2.2 line the 3-fold axis; D3 and a stem pack against the outer surface. Surprisingly, hydrogen-deuterium exchange shows that surfaces of D1, D2.2 and D3 closest to the 3-fold axis are more dynamic than exposed surfaces. Three fusion helices in the fusion loops of each monomer expose hydrophobic residues at the trimer apex that are splayed from the 3-fold axis, leaving a solvent-filled cavity between the fusion loops in each monomer. At the base of the two fusion loops, Arg185 docks in a carbonyl cage. Comparisons to other structures, dynamics, and the greater effect on &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas&lt;/i&gt; gamete fusion of mutation of axis-proximal than axis-distal fusion helices suggest that the apical portion of each monomer could tilt toward the 3-fold axis with merger of the fusion helices into a common fusion surface.</description>

	<description>Many important gram-negative bacterial pathogens use highly sophisticated type III protein secretion systems (T3SSs) to establish complex host-pathogen interactions. Bacterial-host cell contact triggers the activation of the T3SS and the subsequent insertion of a translocon pore into the target cell membrane, which serves as a conduit for the passage of effector proteins. Therefore the initial interaction between T3SS-bearing bacteria and host cells is the critical step in the deployment of the protein secretion machine, yet this process remains poorly understood. Here, we use high-throughput cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize the T3SS-mediated &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt;-host cell interface. Our analysis reveals the intact translocon at an unprecedented level of resolution, its deployment in the host cell membrane, and the establishment of an intimate association between the bacteria and the target cells, which is essential for effector translocation. Our studies provide critical data supporting the long postulated direct injection model for effector translocation.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Differing isoforms of the cobalamin binding photoreceptor AerR oppositely regulate photosystem expression</title>

	<description>Phototrophic microorganisms adjust photosystem synthesis in response to changes in light intensity and wavelength. A variety of different photoreceptors regulate this process. Purple photosynthetic bacteria synthesize a novel photoreceptor AerR that uses cobalamin (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) as a blue-light absorbing chromophore to control photosystem synthesis. AerR directly interacts with the redox responding transcription factor CrtJ, affecting CrtJ's interaction with photosystem promoters. In this study, we show that AerR is translated as two isoforms that differ by 41 amino acids at the amino terminus. The ratio of these isoforms was affected by light and cell growth phase with the long variant predominating during photosynthetic exponential growth and the short variant predominating in dark conditions and/or stationary phase. Pigmentation and transcriptomic analyses show that the short AerR variant represses, while long variant activates, photosynthesis genes. The long form of AerR also activates many genes involved in cellular metabolism and motility.</description>

	<description>How are decisions made between different goods? One theory spanning several fields of neuroscience proposes that their values are distilled to a single common neural currency, the calculation of which allows for rational decisions. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is thought to play a critical role in this process, based on the presence of neural correlates of economic value in lateral OFC in monkeys and medial OFC in humans. We previously inactivated lateral OFC in rats without affecting economic choice behavior. Here we inactivated medial OFC in the same task, again without effect. Behavior in the same rats was disrupted by inactivation during progressive ratio responding previously shown to depend on medial OFC, demonstrating the efficacy of the inactivation. These results indicate that medial OFC is not necessary for economic choice, bolstering the proposal that classic economic choice is likely mediated by multiple, overlapping neural circuits.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Yeast Ded1 promotes 48S translation pre-initiation complex assembly in an mRNA-specific and eIF4F-dependent manner</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38892</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38892</link>
	<description>DEAD-box RNA helicase Ded1 is thought to resolve secondary structures in mRNA 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs) that impede 48S preinitiation complex (PIC) formation at the initiation codon. We reconstituted Ded1 acceleration of 48S PIC assembly on native mRNAs in a pure system, and recapitulated increased Ded1-dependence of mRNAs that are Ded1-hyperdependent in vivo. Stem-loop (SL) structures in 5′-UTRs of native and synthetic mRNAs increased the Ded1 requirement to overcome their intrinsically low rates of 48S PIC recruitment. Ded1 acceleration of 48S assembly was greater in the presence of eIF4F, and domains mediating one or more Ded1 interactions with eIF4G or helicase eIF4A were required for efficient recruitment of all mRNAs; however, the relative importance of particular Ded1 and eIF4G domains were distinct for each mRNA. Our results account for the Ded1 hyper-dependence of mRNAs with structure-prone 5′-UTRs, and implicate an eIF4E·eIF4G·eIF4A·Ded1 complex in accelerating 48S PIC assembly on native mRNAs.</description>

	<description>In the human fungal pathogen &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus neoformans&lt;/i&gt;, sex can benefit its pathogenicity through production of meiospores, which are believed to offer both physical and meiosis-created lineage advantages for its infections. &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus&lt;/i&gt; sporulation occurs following two parallel events, meiosis and differentiation of the basidium, the characteristic sexual structure of the basidiomycetes. However, the circuit integrating these events to ensure subsequent sporulation is unclear. Here, we show the spatiotemporal coordination of meiosis and basidial maturation by visualizing event-specific molecules in developing basidia defined by a quantitative approach. Monitoring of gene induction timing together with genetic analysis reveals co-regulation of the coordinated events by a shared regulatory program. Two RRM family regulators, Csa1 and Csa2, are crucial components that specifically bridge meiosis and basidial maturation, further determining sporulation. We propose that the regulatory coordination of meiosis and basidial development serves as a determinant underlying the production of infectious meiospores in &lt;i&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

	<description>Alterations in global mRNA decay broadly impact multiple stages of gene expression, although signals that connect these processes are incompletely defined. Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression.</description>

	<description>As part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/&quot;&gt;Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology&lt;/a&gt; we published a Registered Report (Eaton et al., 2015) that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper “Intestinal Inflammation Targets Cancer-Inducing Activity of the Microbiota” (Arthur et al., 2012). Here we report the results. We observed no impact on bacterial growth or colonization capacity when the polyketide synthase (&lt;i&gt;pks&lt;/i&gt;) genotoxic island was deleted from &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; NC101, similar to the original study (Supplementary Figure 7; Arthur et al., 2012). However, for the experiment that compared inflammation, invasion, and neoplasia in azoxymethane (AOM)-treated interleukin-10-deficient mice mono-associated with NC101 or NC101&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;Δ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt; &lt;i&gt;pks&lt;/i&gt; the experimental timing of the replication attempt was longer than that of the original study. This difference was because in the original study the methodology was not clearly stated and likely led to the increased mortality and severity of inflammation observed in this replication attempt. Additionally, early death occurred during AOM treatment with higher mortality observed in NC101&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;Δ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt; &lt;i&gt;pks&lt;/i&gt; mono-associated mice compared to NC101, which was in the same direction, but more severe than the original study (Suppleme1ntal Figure 10; Arthur et al., 2012). A meta-analysis suggests that mice mono-associated with NC101&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;Δ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt; &lt;i&gt;pks&lt;/i&gt; have higher mortality compared to NC101. While these data were unable to address whether, under the conditions of the original study, NC101 and NC101&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;mi&gt;Δ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt; &lt;i&gt;pks&lt;/i&gt; differ in inflammation, invasion, and neoplasia this replication attempt demonstrates that clear description of experimental methods is essential to ensure accurate reproduction of experimental studies.</description>

	<description>Adult skeletal muscle maintenance and regeneration depend on efficient muscle stem cell (MuSC) functions. The mechanisms coordinating cell cycle with activation, renewal, and differentiation of MuSCs remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated how adult MuSCs are regulated by &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;CDKN1c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (p57&lt;sup&gt;kip2&lt;/sup&gt;), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, using mouse molecular genetics. In the absence of &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;CDKN1c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, skeletal muscle repair is severely impaired after injury. We show that &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;CDKN1c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is not expressed in quiescent MuSCs, while being induced in activated and proliferating myoblasts and maintained in differentiating myogenic cells. In agreement, isolated &lt;i&gt;Cdkn1c&lt;/i&gt;-deficient primary myoblasts display differentiation defects and increased proliferation. We further show that the subcellular localization of &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;CDKN1c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is dynamic; while &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;CDKN1c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is initially localized to the cytoplasm of activated/proliferating myoblasts, progressive nuclear translocation leads to growth arrest during differentiation. We propose that &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;CDKN1c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; activity is restricted to differentiating myoblasts by regulated cyto-nuclear relocalization, coordinating the balance between proliferation and growth arrest.</description>

The critical period for cortical plasticity closes in adults, thus restricting the brain’s ability to indiscriminately store new sensory information. For example, children acquire language in an exposure-based manner, whereas learning language in adulthood requires more effort and attention. It has been suggested that pairing sounds with the activation of neuromodulatory circuits involved in attention reopens this critical period. Here, we review two critical period hypotheses related to neuromodulation: cortical disinhibition and thalamic adenosine. We posit that these mechanisms co-regulate the critical period for auditory cortical plasticity. We also discuss ways to reopen this period and rejuvenate cortical plasticity in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Two types of slow waves in anesthetized and sleeping brains. (arXiv:1810.00816v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00816</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00816</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep and anesthesia have contrasting effects on memory, yet at the
microscopic scale they appear to produce similar neural network dynamics
consisting of slow waves associated with alternating transients of high
activity (UP states) and silence (DOWN states). Here, UP and DOWN state
dynamics are analyzed in cortical recordings from human, monkey, and rat and
found to be robustly different between deep sleep and anesthesia. We found that
the temporal statistics of UP and DOWN states is robustly different in natural
slow-wave sleep compared to the slow-waves of anesthesia. Computational models
predict that an interplay between noise and spike-frequency adaptation can
yield a transition from sleep-like to anesthesia-like slow-wave dynamics. These
predictions were confirmed by pharmacological manipulations in vitro, inducing
a switch between the two types of slow-waves. The results show that the strong
adaptation found in anesthesia, but not in sleep, can produce a different type
of slow oscillations, less sensitive to external inputs, that may prevent
memory formation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Caulking the Leakage Effect in MEEG Source Connectivity Analysis. (arXiv:1810.00786v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00786</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00786</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Simplistic estimation of neural connectivity in MEEG sensor space is
impossible due to volume conduction. The only viable alternative is to carry
out connectivity estimation in source space. Among the neuroscience community
this is claimed to be impossible or misleading due to Leakage: linear mixing of
the reconstructed sources. To address this problematic we propose a novel
solution method that caulks the Leakage in MEEG source activity and
connectivity estimates: BC-VARETA. It is based on a joint estimation of source
activity and connectivity in the frequency domain representation of MEEG time
series. To achieve this, we go beyond current methods that assume a fixed
gaussian graphical model for source connectivity. In contrast we estimate this
graphical model in a Bayesian framework by placing priors on it, which allows
for highly optimized computations of the connectivity, via a new procedure
based on the local quadratic approximation under quite general prior models. A
further contribution of this paper is the rigorous definition of leakage via
the Spatial Dispersion Measure and Earth Movers Distance based on the geodesic
distances over the cortical manifold. Both measures are extended for the first
time to quantify Connectivity Leakage by defining them on the cartesian product
of cortical manifolds. Using these measures, we show that BC-VARETA outperforms
most state of the art inverse solvers by several orders of magnitude.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Stable Brain-Machine Interfaces. (arXiv:1810.00045v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00045</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00045</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) have recently emerged as a clinically viable
option to restore voluntary movements after paralysis. These devices are based
on the ability to extract information about movement intent from neural signals
recorded using multi-electrode arrays chronically implanted in the motor
cortices of the brain. However, the inherent loss and turnover of recorded
neurons requires repeated recalibrations of the interface, which can
potentially alter the day-to-day user experience. The resulting need for
continued user adaptation interferes with the natural, subconscious use of the
BMI. Here, we introduce a new computational approach that decodes movement
intent from a low-dimensional latent representation of the neural data. We
implement various domain adaptation methods to stabilize the interface over
significantly long times. This includes Canonical Correlation Analysis used to
align the latent variables across days; this method requires prior
point-to-point correspondence of the time series across domains. Alternatively,
we match the empirical probability distributions of the latent variables across
days through the minimization of their Kullback-Leibler divergence. These two
methods provide a significant and comparable improvement in the performance of
the interface. However, implementation of an Adversarial Domain Adaptation
Network trained to match the empirical probability distribution of the
residuals of the reconstructed neural signals outperforms the two methods based
on latent variables, while requiring remarkably few data points to solve the
domain adaptation problem.

	<description>The C-cluster of the enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) is a structurally distinctive Ni-Fe-S cluster employed to catalyze the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO as part of the Wood-Ljungdahl carbon fixation pathway. Using X-ray crystallography, we have observed unprecedented conformational dynamics in the C-cluster of the CODH from &lt;i&gt;Desulfovibrio vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;, providing the first view of an oxidized state of the cluster. Combined with supporting spectroscopic data, our structures reveal that this novel, oxidized cluster arrangement plays a role in avoiding irreversible oxidative degradation at the C-cluster. Furthermore, mutagenesis of a conserved cysteine residue that binds the C-cluster in the oxidized state but not in the reduced state suggests that the oxidized conformation could be important for proper cluster assembly, in particular Ni incorporation. Together, these results lay a foundation for future investigations of C-cluster activation and assembly, and contribute to an emerging paradigm of metallocluster plasticity.</description>

	<description>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological condition for which there are currently no effective treatment options to restore function. A major obstacle to the development of new therapies is our fragmentary understanding of the coordinated pathophysiological processes triggered by damage to the human spinal cord. Here, we describe a systems biology approach to integrate decades of small-scale experiments with unbiased, genome-wide gene expression from the human spinal cord, revealing a gene regulatory network signature of the pathophysiological response to SCI. Our integrative analyses converge on an evolutionarily conserved gene subnetwork enriched for genes associated with the response to SCI by small-scale experiments, and whose expression is upregulated in a severity-dependent manner following injury and downregulated in functional recovery. We validate the severity-dependent upregulation of this subnetwork in rodents in primary transcriptomic and proteomic studies. Our analysis provides systems-level view of the coordinated molecular processes activated in response to SCI.</description>

Here we present an open-source R package ‘meaRtools’ that provides a platform for analyzing neuronal networks recorded on Microelectrode Arrays (MEAs). Cultured neuronal networks monitored with MEAs are now being widely used to characterize &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models of neurological disorders and to evaluate pharmaceutical compounds. meaRtools provides core algorithms for MEA spike train analysis, feature extraction, statistical analysis and plotting of multiple MEA recordings with multiple genotypes and treatments. meaRtools functionality covers novel solutions for spike train analysis, including algorithms to assess electrode cross-correlation using the spike train tiling coefficient (STTC), mutual information, synchronized bursts and entropy within cultured wells. Also integrated is a solution to account for bursts variability originating from mixed-cell neuronal cultures. The package provides a statistical platform built specifically for MEA data that can combine multiple MEA recordings and compare extracted features between different genetic models or treatments. We demonstrate the utilization of meaRtools to successfully identify epilepsy-like phenotypes in neuronal networks from &lt;i&gt;Celf4&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice. The package is freely available under the GPL license (GPL&amp;gt; = 3) and is updated frequently on the CRAN web-server repository. The package, along with full documentation can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meaRtools/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pDffSPfFxsQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Exploring the impact of inoculum dose on host immunity and morbidity to inform model-based vaccine design</title>

Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. We illustrate the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines, wby fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tR55K82RYTM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Collective cell migration in cohesive units is vital for tissue morphogenesis, wound repair, and immune response. While the fundamental driving forces for collective cell motion stem from contractile and protrusive activities of individual cells, it remains unknown how their balance is optimized to maintain tissue cohesiveness and the fluidity for motion. Here we present a cell-based computational model for collective cell migration during wound healing that incorporates mechanochemical coupling of cell motion and adhesion kinetics with stochastic transformation of active motility forces. We show that a balance of protrusive motility and actomyosin contractility is optimized for accelerating the rate of wound repair, which is robust to variations in cell and substrate mechanical properties. This balance underlies rapid collective cell motion during wound healing, resulting from a tradeoff between tension mediated collective cell guidance and active stress relaxation in the tissue.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jnAyESMj4zg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Linking signal detection theory and encoding models to reveal independent neural representations from neuroimaging data</title>

Many research questions in visual perception involve determining whether stimulus properties are represented and processed independently. In visual neuroscience, there is great interest in determining whether important object dimensions are represented independently in the brain. For example, theories of face recognition have proposed either completely or partially independent processing of identity and emotional expression. Unfortunately, most previous research has only vaguely defined what is meant by “independence,” which hinders its precise quantification and testing. This article develops a new quantitative framework that links signal detection theory from psychophysics and encoding models from computational neuroscience, focusing on a special form of independence defined in the psychophysics literature: perceptual separability. The new theory allowed us, for the first time, to precisely define separability of neural representations and to theoretically link behavioral and brain measures of separability. The framework formally specifies the relation between these different levels of perceptual and brain representation, providing the tools for a truly integrative research approach. In particular, the theory identifies exactly what valid inferences can be made about independent encoding of stimulus dimensions from the results of multivariate analyses of neuroimaging data and psychophysical studies. In addition, commonly used operational tests of independence are re-interpreted within this new theoretical framework, providing insights on their correct use and interpretation. Finally, we apply this new framework to the study of separability of brain representations of face identity and emotional expression (neutral/sad) in a human fMRI study with male and female participants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qnPjy-Per_4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Use of an individual-based model of pneumococcal carriage for planning a randomized trial of a whole-cell vaccine</title>

For encapsulated bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, asymptomatic carriage is more common and longer in duration than disease, and hence is often a more convenient endpoint for clinical trials of vaccines against these bacteria. However, using a carriage endpoint entails specific challenges. Carriage is almost always measured as prevalence, whereas the vaccine may act by reducing incidence or duration. Thus, to determine sample size requirements, its impact on prevalence must first be estimated. The relationship between incidence and prevalence (or duration and prevalence) is convex, saturating at 100% prevalence. For this reason, the proportional effect of a vaccine on prevalence is typically less than its proportional effect on incidence or duration. This relationship is further complicated in the presence of multiple pathogen strains. In addition, host immunity to carriage accumulates rapidly with frequent exposures in early years of life, creating potentially complex interactions with the vaccine’s effect. We conducted a simulation study to predict the impact of an inactivated whole cell pneumococcal vaccine—believed to reduce carriage duration—on carriage prevalence in different age groups and trial settings. We used an individual-based model of pneumococcal carriage that incorporates relevant immunological processes, both vaccine-induced and naturally acquired. Our simulations showed that for a wide range of vaccine efficacies, sampling time and age at vaccination are important determinants of sample size. There is a window of favorable sampling times during which the required sample size is relatively low, and this window is prolonged with a younger age at vaccination, and in a trial setting with lower transmission intensity. These results illustrate the ability of simulation studies to inform the planning of vaccine trials with carriage endpoints, and the methods we present here can be applied to trials evaluating other pneumococcal vaccine candidates or comparing alternative dosing schedules for the existing conjugate vaccines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c40RPkVFr3Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cocaine Exposure Modulates Perineuronal Nets and Synaptic Excitability of Fast-spiking Interneurons in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that perineuronal nets (PNNs) are required for cocaine-associated memories. Perineuronal nets are extracellular matrix that primarily surrounds parvalbumin (PV)-containing, GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here we measured the impact of acute (1 day) or repeated (5 days) cocaine exposure on PNNs and PV cells within the prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the mPFC. Adult rats were exposed to 1 day or 5 days of cocaine and stained for PNNs (using &lt;i&gt;Wisteria floribunda&lt;/i&gt; agglutinin, WFA) and PV intensity 2 h or 24 h later. In the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC, PNN staining intensity decreased 2 hr after 1 day of cocaine but increased after 5 days of cocaine. Cocaine also produced changes in PV intensity, which generally lagged behind that of PNNs. In the prelimbic PFC, both 1 and 5 days of cocaine increased GAD65/67 puncta near PNN-surrounded PV cells, with an increase in the ratio of GAD65/67:VGluT1 puncta after 5 days of cocaine exposure. In the prelimbic PFC, slice electrophysiology studies in FSIs surrounded by PNNs revealed that both 1 and 5 days of cocaine reduced the number of action potentials 2 h later. Synaptic changes demonstrated that 5 d cocaine increased inhibition of FSIs, potentially reducing the inhibition of pyramidal neurons and contributing to their hyperexcitability during relapse behavior. These early and rapid responses to cocaine may alter network stability of PV FSIs that partially mediate the persistent and chronic nature of drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Parvalbumin-containing, FSIs control the inhibitory:excitatory balance in the adult CNS, and the majority of these are surrounded by PNNs. The mPFC is critical to relapse in cocaine addiction, yet few studies have focused on the impact of cocaine exposure on PV interneurons that profoundly control output of the mPFC. Our studies highlight the impact of cocaine on PV and PNN levels and intrinsic and synaptic properties of PNN-surrounded FSIs in the mPFC. These findings point to a key upstream mechanism by which FSIs may contribute to the consistently observed increase in mPFC excitatory output of pyramidal neurons that contribute to cocaine reinstatement, and they have broader implications for understanding how PNN-surrounded neurons may control aberrant learning processes involved in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Simultaneous assessment of homonymous and heteronymous monosynaptic reflex excitability in the adult rat</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In order to successfully produce motor tasks such as locomotion, the central nervous system must coordinate contractions of antagonistic and synergistic muscles across multiple joints. This coordination is largely dependent upon the function of proprioceptive afferents, which make monosynaptic connections with homonymous motoneurons. Homonymous pathways have been well studied in both health and disease but their collateral fibres projecting to heteronymous, synergistic muscles receive relatively less attention. This is surprising given that proprioceptive afferent collaterals have significant effects on the excitability of heteronymous motoneurons, and that their synaptic terminal density is activity dependent. It is likely that the relative lack of literature is due to the lack of a preparation which allows synergistic heteronymous pathways to be assessed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we describe a method to simultaneously evoke homonymous and heteronymous (synergistic) monosynaptic reflexes and study their modulation by descending pathways in adult rats. Through stimulation of the medial plantar nerve, we were able to produce an H reflex in the intrinsic foot muscles of the hind paw with a latency of 10.52 ± 3.8 ms. Increasing the stimulus intensity evoked a robust signal with a monosynaptic latency (11.32 ± 0.35 ms), recorded in the ipsilateral gastrocnemius. Our subsequent analyses suggest that gastrocnemius motoneurons were activated via heteronymous afferent collaterals from the medial plantar nerve. These reflexes could be evoked bilaterally and were modulated by conditioning stimuli to the cortex and reticular formation. Interestingly, cortical stimulation was equally efficient at modulating both ipsilateral and contralateral reflexes, indicating that cortical modulation of lumbar sensory afferents lacks the laterality demonstrated by studies of cortical muscle activation. This technique represents a novel, relatively simple way to assess heteronymous afferent pathways in normal motor control as well as in models of motor disorders where adaptive and maladaptive plasticity of proprioceptive afferents and descending systems affects functional outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; This study describes a method for simultaneously recording bilateral homonymous and heteronymous proprioceptive afferent reflexes in rodents. Bilateral stimulation of the medial plantar nerve produced homonymous H reflexes in intrinsic foot muscles of both hind paws as well as heteronymous monosynaptic reflexes in the gastrocnemius muscles. We used this technique to assess cortical and reticular modulation of homonymous and heteronymous reflexes. Surprisingly, cortical conditioning of reflexes revealed a lack of laterality in modulation of homonymous and heteronymous reflexes. This technique will be extremely useful for further studies of heteronymous afferent pathways in normal and dysfunctional motor states, such as spinal cord injury, stroke and cerebral palsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Idiosyncratic, retinotopic bias in face identification modulated by familiarity</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The perception of gender and age of unfamiliar faces is reported to vary idiosyncratically across retinal locations such that, for example, the same androgynous face may appear to be male at one location but female at another. Here we test spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of the &lt;i&gt;identity&lt;/i&gt; of personally familiar faces in human participants. We found idiosyncratic biases that were stable within participants and that varied more across locations for low as compared to high familiar faces. These data suggest that like face gender and age, face identity is processed, in part, by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that the recognition responses vary for the same face across these different locations. Moreover, repeated and varied social interactions appear to lead to adjustments of these independent face recognition neurons so that the same familiar face is eventually more likely to elicit the same recognition response across widely separated visual field locations. We provide a mechanistic account of this reduced retinotopic bias based on computational simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; In this work we tested spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of personally familiar faces. We found retinotopic biases that varied more across locations for low as compared to highly familiar faces. The retinotopic biases were idiosyncratic and stable within participants. Our data suggest that, like face gender and age, face identity is processed by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that recognition may vary for the same face at these different locations. Unlike previous findings, our data and computational simulation address the effects of learning and show how increased familiarity modifies the representation of face identity in face-responsive cortical areas. This new perspective has broader implications for understanding how learning optimizes visual processes for socially salient stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Continuous attractors have been used to understand recent neuroscience
experiments where persistent activity patterns encode internal representations
of external attributes like head direction or spatial location. However, the
conditions under which the emergent bump of neural activity in such networks
can be manipulated by space and time-dependent external sensory or motor
signals are not understood. Here, we find fundamental limits on how rapidly
internal representations encoded along continuous attractors can be updated by
an external signal. We apply these results to place cell networks to derive a
velocity-dependent non-equilibrium memory capacity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Differential Degree Test for Comparing Brain Networks. (arXiv:1809.11098v1 [stat.AP])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, graph theory has become a popular method for characterizing brain
functional organization. One important goal in graph theoretical analysis of
brain networks is to identify network differences across disease types or
conditions. Typical approaches include massive univariate testing of each edge
or comparisons of local and/or global network metrics to identify deviations in
topological organization. Some limitations of these methods include low
statistical power due to the large number of comparisons and difficulty
attributing overall differences in networks to local variations in brain
function. We propose a novel differential degree test (DDT) to identify brain
regions incident to a large number of differentially weighted edges across two
populations. The proposed test could help detect key brain locations involved
in diseases by demonstrating significantly altered neural connections. We
achieve this by generating an appropriate set of null networks which are
matched on the first and second moments of the observed difference network
using the Hirschberger-Qi-Steuer (HQS) algorithm. This formulation permits
separation of the network's true topology from the nuisance topology which is
induced by the correlation measure and may drive inter-regional connectivity in
ways unrelated to the brain function. Simulations indicate that the proposed
approach routinely outperforms competing methods in detecting differentially
connected regions of interest. Furthermore, we propose a data-adaptive
threshold selection procedure which is able to detect differentially weighted
edges and is shown to outperform competing methods that perform edge-wise
comparisons controlling for the error rate. An application of our method to a
major depressive disorder dataset leads to the identification of brain regions
in the default mode network commonly implicated in this ruminative disorder.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Inhibition of TrkB- and TrkC-Signaling Pathways Affects Neurogenesis in the Opossum Developing Neocortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy246</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy246/5112945?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We have previously reported that the blockage of TrkB and TrkC signaling in primary culture of opossum neocortical cells affects neurogenesis that involves a range of processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Here, we studied whether TrkB and TrkC activity specifically affects various types of progenitor cell populations during neocortex formation in the Monodelphis opossum in vivo. We found that the inhibition of TrkB and TrkC activities affects the same proliferative cellular phenotype, but TrkC causes more pronounced changes in the rate of cell divisions. Additionally, inhibition of TrkB and TrkC does not affect apoptosis in vivo, which was found in cell culture experiments. The lack of TrkB and TrkC receptor activity caused the arrest of newly generated neurons; therefore, they could not penetrate the subplate zone. We suggest that at this time point in development, migration consists of 2 steps. During the initial step, neurons migrate and reach the base of the subplate, whereas during the next step the migration of neurons to their final position is regulated by TrkB or TrkC signaling.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hippocampal Shape Maturation in Childhood and Adolescence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy244</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy244/5112943?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The hippocampus is a subcortical structure critical for learning and memory, and a thorough understanding of its neurodevelopment is important for studying these processes in health and disease. However, few studies have quantified the typical developmental trajectory of the structure in childhood and adolescence. This study examined the cross-sectional age-related changes and sex differences in hippocampal shape in a multisite, multistudy cohort of 1676 typically developing children (age 1–22 years) using a novel intrinsic brain mapping method based on Laplace–Beltrami embedding of surfaces. Significant age-related expansion was observed bilaterally and nonlinear growth was observed primarily in the right head and tail of the hippocampus. Sex differences were also observed bilaterally along the lateral and medial aspects of the surface, with females exhibiting relatively larger surface expansion than males. Additionally, the superior posterior lateral surface of the left hippocampus exhibited an age–sex interaction with females expanding faster than males. Shape analysis provides enhanced sensitivity to regional changes in hippocampal morphology over traditional volumetric approaches and allows for the localization of developmental effects. Our results further support evidence that hippocampal structures follow distinct maturational trajectories that may coincide with the development of learning and memory skills during critical periods of development.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hierarchical Brain Network for Face and Voice Integration of Emotion Expression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy240</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy240/5112944?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The brain has separate specialized computational units to process faces and voices located in occipital and temporal cortices. However, humans seamlessly integrate signals from the faces and voices of others for optimal social interaction. How are emotional expressions, when delivered by different sensory modalities (faces and voices), integrated in the brain? In this study, we characterized the brains’ response to faces, voices, and combined face–voice information (congruent, incongruent), which varied in expression (neutral, fearful). Using a whole-brain approach, we found that only the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) responded more to bimodal stimuli than to face or voice alone but only when the stimuli contained emotional expression. Face- and voice-selective regions of interest, extracted from independent functional localizers, similarly revealed multisensory integration in the face-selective rpSTS only; further, this was the only face-selective region that also responded significantly to voices. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that the rpSTS receives unidirectional information from the face-selective fusiform face area, and voice-selective temporal voice area, with emotional expression affecting the connection strength. Our study promotes a hierarchical model of face and voice integration, with convergence in the rpSTS, and that such integration depends on the (emotional) salience of the stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Neuroanatomy of Autism Spectrum Disorder Symptomatology in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy239</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy239/5112941?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a genetic condition associated with a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions that include autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While evidence suggests that clinical phenotypes represent distinct neurodevelopmental outcomes, it remains unknown whether this translates to the level of neurobiology. To fractionate the 22q11.2DS phenotype on the level of neuroanatomy, we examined differences in vertex-wise estimates of cortical volume, surface area, and cortical thickness between 1) individuals with 22q11.2DS (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 62) and neurotypical controls (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 57) and 2) 22q11.2DS individuals with ASD symptomatology (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 30) and those without (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 25). We firstly observed significant differences in surface anatomy between 22q11.2DS individuals and controls for all 3 neuroanatomical features, predominantly in parietotemporal regions, cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. We also established that 22q11.2DS individuals with ASD symptomatology were neuroanatomically distinct from 22q11.2DS individuals without ASD symptoms, particularly in brain regions that have previously been linked to ASD (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and the entorhinal cortex). Our findings indicate that different clinical 22q11.2DS phenotypes, including those with ASD symptomatology, may represent different neurobiological subgroups. The spatially distributed patterns of neuroanatomical differences associated with ASD symptomatology in 22q11.2DS may thus provide useful information for patient stratification and the prediction of clinical outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dissociable Roles Within the Social Brain for Self–Other Processing: A HD-tDCS Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy238</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy238/5112938?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Theories of right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) function in social cognition include self–other distinction, self-inhibition, or embodied rotation, whereas the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is associated with integrating social information. However, no study has provided causal evidence for dissociable roles of the rTPJ and dmPFC in social cognition. A total of 52 healthy young adults were stratified to receive either dmPFC or rTPJ anodal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) in a sham-controlled, double-blinded, repeated measures design. Self–other processing was assessed across implicit and explicit level 1 (line-of-sight) and level 2 (mental rotation) visual perspective taking (VPT) tasks, and self–other effects on memory. DmPFC stimulation selectively increased the influence of the allocentric perspective during egocentric perspective taking, indexed by an increase in congruency effect across explicit VPT tasks. Moreover, dmPFC stimulation removed the self-reference effect in episodic memory by increasing the recognition of other and decreasing the recognition of self-encoded words. Stimulation of the rTPJ resulted in improved inhibition of the egocentric-perspective during level 2 VPT only, indexed by a reduction of the congruency effect when taking the allocentric perspective. This research supports theories suggesting that the rTPJ facilitates embodied mental rotation of the self into an alternate perspective, whereas the dmPFC integrates social information relevant to self-directed processes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Early-Emerging Sulcal Patterns Are Atypical in Fetuses with Congenital Heart Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy235</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy235/5112934?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fetuses with congenital heart disease (CHD) have third trimester alterations in cortical development on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the intersulcal relationships contributing to global sulcal pattern remain unknown. This study applied a novel method for examining the geometric and topological relationships between sulci to fetal brain MRIs from 21–30 gestational weeks in CHD fetuses (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 19) and typically developing (TD) fetuses (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 17). Sulcal pattern similarity index (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SI&lt;/span&gt;) to template fetal brain MRIs was determined for the position, area, and depth for corresponding sulcal basins and intersulcal relationships for each subject. CHD fetuses demonstrated altered global sulcal patterns in the left hemisphere compared with TD fetuses (TD [&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SI&lt;/span&gt;, mean ± SD]: 0.822 ± 0.023, CHD: 0.795 ± 0.030, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.002). These differences were present in the earliest emerging sulci and were driven by differences in the position of corresponding sulcal basins (TD: 0.897 ± 0.024, CHD: 0.878 ± 0.019, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P =&lt;/span&gt; 0.006) and intersulcal relationships (TD: 0.876 ± 0.031, CHD: 0.857 ± 0.018, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.033). No differences in cortical gyrification index, mean curvature, or surface area were present. These data suggest our methods may be more sensitive than traditional measures for evaluating cortical developmental alterations early in gestation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Direct Relay Pathways from Lemniscal Auditory Thalamus to Secondary Auditory Field in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Tonotopy is an essential functional organization in the mammalian auditory cortex, and its source in the primary auditory cortex (A1) is the incoming frequency-related topographical projections from the ventral division of the medial geniculate body (MGv). However, circuits that relay this functional organization to higher-order regions such as the secondary auditory field (A2) have yet to be identified. Here, we discovered a new pathway that projects directly from MGv to A2 in mice. Tonotopy was established in A2 even when primary fields including A1 were removed, which indicates that tonotopy in A2 can be established solely by thalamic input. Moreover, the structural nature of differing thalamocortical connections was consistent with the functional organization of the target regions in the auditory cortex. Retrograde tracing revealed that the region of MGv input to a local area in A2 was broader than the region of MGv input to A1. Consistent with this anatomy, two-photon calcium imaging revealed that neuronal responses in the thalamocortical recipient layer of A2 showed wider bandwidth and greater heterogeneity of the best frequency distribution than those of A1. The current study demonstrates a new thalamocortical pathway that relays frequency information to A2 on the basis of the MGv compartmentalization.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: NFIX-Mediated Inhibition of Neuroblast Branching Regulates Migration Within the Adult Mouse Ventricular–Subventricular Zone</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy233</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy233/5112942?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Understanding the migration of newborn neurons within the brain presents a major challenge in contemporary biology. Neuronal migration is widespread within the developing brain but is also important within the adult brain. For instance, stem cells within the ventricular–subventricular zone (V-SVZ) and the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus of the adult rodent brain produce neuroblasts that migrate to the olfactory bulb and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, respectively, where they regulate key brain functions including innate olfactory responses, learning, and memory. Critically, our understanding of the factors mediating neuroblast migration remains limited. The transcription factor nuclear factor I X (NFIX) has previously been implicated in embryonic cortical development. Here, we employed conditional ablation of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nfix&lt;/span&gt; from the adult mouse brain and demonstrated that the removal of this gene from either neural stem and progenitor cells, or neuroblasts, within the V-SVZ culminated in neuroblast migration defects. Mechanistically, we identified aberrant neuroblast branching, due in part to increased expression of the guanylyl cyclase natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Npr2&lt;/span&gt;), as a factor contributing to abnormal migration in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nfix&lt;/span&gt;-deficient adult mice. Collectively, these data provide new insights into how neuroblast migration is regulated at a transcriptional level within the adult brain.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Reconfiguration of Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Sensory and Perceptual System in Schizophrenia</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Schizophrenia is thought as a self-disorder with dysfunctional brain connectivity. This self-disorder is often attributed to high-order cognitive impairment. Yet due to the frequent report of sensorial and perceptual deficits, it has been hypothesized that self-disorder in schizophrenia is dysfunctional communication between sensory and cognitive processes. To further verify this assumption, the present study comprehensively examined dynamic reconfigurations of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in schizophrenia at voxel level, region level, and network levels (102 patients vs. 124 controls). We found patients who show consistently increased rsFC variability in sensory and perceptual system, including visual network, sensorimotor network, attention network, and thalamus at all the three levels. However, decreased variability in high-order networks, such as default mode network and frontal–parietal network were only consistently observed at region and network levels. Taken together, these findings highlighted the rudimentary role of elevated instability of information communication in sensory and perceptual system and attenuated whole-brain integration of high-order network in schizophrenia, which provided novel neural evidence to support the hypothesis of disrupted perceptual and cognitive function in schizophrenia. The foci of effects also highlighted that targeting perceptual deficits can be regarded as the key to enhance our understanding of pathophysiology in schizophrenia and promote new treatment intervention.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Altered White Matter Organization in the TUBB3 E410K Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy231</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy231/5112937?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Seven unrelated individuals (four pediatric, three adults) with the TUBB3 E410K syndrome, harboring identical de novo heterozygous &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;TUBB3&lt;/span&gt; c.1228 G&amp;gt;A mutations, underwent neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Despite the absence of cortical malformations, they have intellectual and social disabilities. To search for potential etiologies for these deficits, we compared their brain's structural and white matter organization to 22 controls using structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion images were processed to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA) and perform tract reconstructions. Cortical parcellation-based network analysis and gyral topology-based FA analyses were performed. Major interhemispheric, projection and intrahemispheric tracts were manually segmented. Subjects had decreased corpus callosum volume and decreased network efficiency. While only pediatric subjects had diffuse decreases in FA predominantly affecting mid- and long-range tracts, only adult subjects had white matter volume loss associated with decreased cortical surface area. All subjects showed aberrant corticospinal tract trajectory and bilateral absence of the dorsal language network long segment. Furthermore, pediatric subjects had more tracts with decreased FA compared with controls than did adult subjects. These findings define a TUBB3 E410K neuroimaging endophenotype and lead to the hypothesis that the age-related changes are due to microscopic intrahemispheric misguided axons that are pruned during maturation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Computational Feature Analysis of Body Movements Reveals Hierarchical Brain Organization</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Social species spend considerable time observing the body movements of others to understand their actions, predict their emotions, watch their games, or enjoy their dance movements. Given the important information obtained from body movements, we still know surprisingly little about the details of brain mechanisms underlying movement perception. In this fMRI study, we investigated the relations between movement features obtained from automated computational analyses of video clips and the corresponding brain activity. Our results show that low-level computational features map to specific brain areas related to early visual- and motion-sensitive regions, while mid-level computational features are related to dynamic aspects of posture encoded in occipital–temporal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus and superior parietal lobe. Furthermore, behavioral features obtained from subjective ratings correlated with activity in higher action observation regions. Our computational feature-based analysis suggests that the neural mechanism of movement encoding is organized in the brain not so much by semantic categories than by feature statistics of the body movements.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Early Developmental Trajectories of Functional Connectivity Along the Visual Pathways in Rhesus Monkeys</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy222/5112931?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Early social interactions shape the development of social behavior, although the critical periods or the underlying neurodevelopmental processes are not completely understood. Here, we studied the developmental changes in neural pathways underlying visual social engagement in the translational rhesus monkey model. Changes in functional connectivity (FC) along the ventral object and motion pathways and the dorsal attention/visuo-spatial pathways were studied longitudinally using resting-state functional MRI in infant rhesus monkeys, from birth through early weaning (3 months), given the socioemotional changes experienced during this period. Our results revealed that (1) maturation along the visual pathways proceeds in a caudo-rostral progression with primary visual areas (V1–V3) showing strong FC as early as 2 weeks of age, whereas higher-order visual and attentional areas (e.g., MT–AST, LIP–FEF) show weak FC; (2) functional changes were pathway-specific (e.g., robust FC increases detected in the most anterior aspect of the object pathway (TE–AMY), but FC remained weak in the other pathways (e.g., AST–AMY)); (3) FC matures similarly in both right and left hemispheres. Our findings suggest that visual pathways in infant macaques undergo selective remodeling during the first 3 months of life, likely regulated by early social interactions and supporting the transition to independence from the mother.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Shared Genetic Basis of Educational Attainment and Cerebral Cortical Morphology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy216</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individual differences in educational attainment are linked to differences in intelligence, and predict important social, economic, and health outcomes. Previous studies have found common genetic factors that influence educational achievement, cognitive performance and total brain volume (i.e., brain size). Here, in a large sample of participants from the UK Biobank, we investigate the shared genetic basis between educational attainment and fine-grained cerebral cortical morphological features, and associate this genetic variation with a related aspect of cognitive ability. Importantly, we execute novel statistical methods that enable high-dimensional genetic correlation analysis, and compute high-resolution surface maps for the genetic correlations between educational attainment and vertex-wise morphological measurements. We conduct secondary analyses, using the UK Biobank verbal–numerical reasoning score, to confirm that variation in educational attainment that is genetically correlated with cortical morphology is related to differences in cognitive performance. Our analyses relate the genetic overlap between cognitive ability and cortical thickness measurements to bilateral primary motor cortex as well as predominantly left superior temporal cortex and proximal regions. These findings extend our understanding of the neurobiology that connects genetic variation to individual differences in educational attainment and cognitive performance.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Development and Decline of the Hippocampal Long-Axis Specialization and Differentiation During Encoding and Retrieval of Episodic Memories</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy209</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Change in hippocampal function is a major factor in life span development and decline of episodic memory. Evidence indicates a long-axis specialization where anterior hippocampus is more engaged during encoding than during retrieval, and posterior more engaged during retrieval than during encoding. We tested the life span trajectory of hippocampal long-axis episodic memory-related activity and functional connectivity (FC) in 496 participants (6.8–80.8 years) encoding and retrieving associative memories. We found evidence for a long-axis encoding–retrieval specialization that declined linearly during development and aging, eventually vanishing in the older adults. This was mainly driven by age effects on retrieval, which was associated with gradually lower activity from childhood to adulthood, followed by positive age relationships until 70 years. This pattern of age effects characterized task engagement regardless of memory success or failure. Especially for retrieval, children engaged posterior hippocampus more than anterior, while anterior was relatively more activated already in teenagers. Significant intrahippocampal connectivity was found during task, which declined with age. The results suggest that hippocampal long-axis differentiation and communication during episodic memory tasks develop rapidly during childhood, are different in older compared with younger adults, and that the age effects are related to task engagement, not the successful retrieval of episodic memories specifically.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individuals from different social groups interpret the world in different ways. This study explores the neural basis of these group differences using a paradigm that simulates natural viewing conditions. Our aim was to determine if group differences could be found in sensory regions involved in the perception of the world or were evident in higher-level regions that are important for the interpretation of sensory information. We measured brain responses from 2 groups of football supporters, while they watched a video of matches between their teams. The time-course of response was then compared between individuals supporting the same (within-group) or the different (between-group) team. We found high intersubject correlations in low-level and high-level regions of the visual brain. However, these regions of the brain did not show any group differences. Regions that showed higher correlations for individuals from the same group were found in a network of frontal and subcortical brain regions. The interplay between these regions suggests a range of cognitive processes from motor control to social cognition and reward are important in the establishment of social groups. These results suggest that group differences are primarily reflected in regions involved in the evaluation and interpretation of the sensory input.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Recent advances in Ca2+ imaging have given neuroscientists a tool to follow the activity of large numbers of individual neurons simultaneously in vivo in the brains of animals as they are presented with sensory stimulation, respond to environmental challenges, and engage in behaviors. The Ca2+ sensors used to transduce changes in cellular Ca2+ into changes in fluorescence must bind Ca2+ to produce a signal. By binding Ca2+, these sensors can act as buffers, often reducing the magnitude of a Ca2+ change severalfold, and producing a proportional slowing of the rates of change.</description>

	<description>Millisecond variations in spiking patterns can radically alter motor behavior, suggesting that traditional rate-based theories of motor control require revision. The importance of spike timing in sensorimotor control arises from dynamic interactions between the nervous system, muscles, and the body. New mechanisms, model systems, and theories are revealing how these interactions shape behavior.</description>

	<description>The auditory modality is fundamentally a temporal sense that requires analysis of changes in sound signals on timescales ranging from microseconds to minutes. To generate a faithful representation of changes in sound intensity and frequency over time, sound offsets (disappearances) as well as sound onsets (appearances) must be encoded by the auditory system. We review here the computational significance, perceptual roles, anatomical locations, and cellular and network origins of sound-offset responses in the mammalian auditory brain.</description>

	<description>Sensorimotor predictions are essential for adaptive behavior. In natural environments, events that demand sensorimotor predictions unfold across many timescales, and corresponding temporal predictions (either explicit or implicit) should therefore emerge in brain dynamics. Neuronal oscillations are scale-specific processes found in several frequency bands. They underlie periodicity in sensorimotor processing and can represent temporal predictions via their phase dynamics. These processes build upon endogenous neural rhythmicity and adapt in response to exogenous timing demands.</description>

	<description>The rate of affective disorder is substantially higher in women than in men, and considerable evidence points to the actions of ovarian hormones in mediating this disparity. In this Opinion, we discuss the hypothesis that cyclic changes in ovarian hormone levels produce cyclic alterations in connectivity between the intrinsic networks of the brain. These alterations produce specific temporal windows within the menstrual cycle when internetwork connectivity is increased, associated with increased stress reactivity and better memory for unpleasant, arousing events, leading to increased negative mood and susceptibility to affective disorder.</description>

The selectivity of memory maintenance and retention remains a puzzle, and we here summarise two contributions of our own research to this enigma: the striking impact of the novelty and surprise often of other events happening around the time that a new memory is encoded and how activated prior knowledge guides the updating process that characterises aspects of memory consolidation.</description>

	<description>The neocortex is one of the most distinctive structures of the mammalian brain, yet also one of the most varied in terms of both size and organization. Multiple processes have contributed to this variability, including evolutionary mechanisms (i.e., alterations in gene sequence) that alter the size, organization, and connections of neocortex, and activity dependent mechanisms that can also modify these same features. Thus, changes to the neocortex can occur over different time-scales, including within a single generation.</description>

	<description>The ability to detect time intervals and temporal patterns is critical to some of the most fundamental computations the brain performs, including the ability to communicate and appraise a dynamically changing environment. Many of these computations take place on the scale of tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Electrophysiological evidence shows that some neurons respond selectively to duration, interval, rate, or order. Because the time constants of many time-varying neural and synaptic properties, including short-term synaptic plasticity (STP), are also in the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds, they are strong candidates to underlie the formation of temporally selective neurons.</description>

	<description>GABAergic interneurons, which are highly diverse, have long been thought to contribute to the timing of neural activity as well as to the generation and shaping of brain rhythms. GABAergic activity is crucial not only for entrainment of oscillatory activity across a neural population, but also for precise regulation of the timing of action potentials and the suppression of slow-timescale correlations. The diversity of inhibition provides the potential for flexible regulation of patterned activity, but also poses a challenge to identifying the elements of excitatory–inhibitory interactions underlying network engagement.</description>

	<description>The rotation of the Earth around its axis causes periodic exposure of half of its surface to sunlight. This daily recurring event has been internalized in most organisms in the form of cellular circadian clock mechanisms. These cellular clocks are synchronized with each other in various ways to establish circadian networks that build the circadian program in tissues and organs, coordinating physiology and behavior in the entire organism. In the mammalian brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) receives light information via the retina and synchronizes its own neuronal clocks to the light signal.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Emergence of spontaneous assembly activity in developing neural networks without afferent input</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Marcus A. Triplett, Lilach Avitan, Geoffrey J. Goodhill&lt;/p&gt;

Spontaneous activity is a fundamental characteristic of the developing nervous system. Intriguingly, it often takes the form of multiple structured assemblies of neurons. Such assemblies can form even in the absence of afferent input, for instance in the zebrafish optic tectum after bilateral enucleation early in life. While the development of neural assemblies based on structured afferent input has been theoretically well-studied, it is less clear how they could arise in systems without afferent input. Here we show that a recurrent network of binary threshold neurons with initially random weights can form neural assemblies based on a simple Hebbian learning rule. Over development the network becomes increasingly modular while being driven by initially unstructured spontaneous activity, leading to the emergence of neural assemblies. Surprisingly, the set of neurons making up each assembly then continues to evolve, despite the number of assemblies remaining roughly constant. In the mature network assembly activity builds over several timesteps before the activation of the full assembly, as recently observed in calcium-imaging experiments. Our results show that Hebbian learning is sufficient to explain the emergence of highly structured patterns of neural activity in the absence of structured input.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-ItVQC45_AI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent comorbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these comorbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here, we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared two months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop comorbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus versus estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with comorbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Functionally Defined In Vivo Astrocyte Population Identified by c-Fos Activation in a Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis Modulated by S1P Signaling: Immediate-Early Astrocytes (ieAstrocytes)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have prominent roles in central nervous system (CNS) function and disease, with subpopulations defined primarily by morphologies and molecular markers often determined in cell culture. Here, we identify an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; astrocyte subpopulation termed immediate-early astrocytes (&lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt;) that is defined by functional c-Fos activation during CNS disease development. An unbiased screen for CNS cells showing c-Fos activation during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), was developed by using inducible, TetTag c-Fos reporter mice that label activated cells with a temporally stable, nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP). Four-dimensional (3D over time) c-Fos activation maps in the spinal cord were produced by combining tissue clearing (iDISCO) and confocal microscopy that identified onset and expansion of GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell populations during EAE. More than 95% of the GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells showed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity—in contrast to absent or rare labeling of neurons, microglia, and infiltrating immune cells—which constituted &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocytes&lt;/i&gt; that linearly increased in number with progression of EAE. &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt; formation was reduced by either astrocyte-specific genetic removal of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) or pharmacological inhibition by fingolimod (FTY720), an FDA-approved MS medicine that can functionally antagonize S1P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ieAstrocyte&lt;/i&gt;s thus represent a functionally defined subset of disease-linked astrocytes that are the first and predominant CNS cell population activated during EAE, and that track with disease severity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Their reduction by a disease-modifying agent supports their therapeutic relevance to MS and potentially other neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Cell cryopreservation improves reproducibility and enables flexibility in experimental design. Although conventional freezing methodologies have been used to preserve primary neurons, poor cell viability and reduced survival severely limited their utility. We screened several high-performance freezing media and found that CryoStor10 (CS10) provided superior cryoprotection to primary mouse embryonic cortical neurons compared to other commercially-available or traditional reagents, permitting the recovery of 68.8% of cells relative to a fresh dissection. We characterized developmental, morphometric, and functional indicators of neuron maturation and found that, without exception, neurons recovered from cryostorage in CS10 media faithfully recapitulate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; neurodevelopment in-step with neurons obtained by fresh dissection. Our method establishes cryopreserved neurons as a reliable, efficient, and equivalent model to fresh neuron cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused in most cases by loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (&lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;). Understanding the pathological processes impacting sensory-motor control represents a major challenge for clinical management of individuals affected by RTT, but the underlying molecular and neuronal modifications remain unclear. We find that symptomatic male &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; knockout (KO) mice show atypically elevated parvalbumin (PV) expression in both somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices together with excessive excitatory inputs converging onto PV-expressing interneurons (INs). In accordance, high-speed voltage-sensitive dye imaging shows reduced amplitude and spatial spread of synaptically induced neuronal depolarizations in S1 of &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Moreover, motor learning-dependent changes of PV expression and structural synaptic plasticity typically occurring on PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; INs in M1 are impaired in symptomatic &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Finally, we find similar abnormalities of PV networks plasticity in symptomatic female &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice. These results indicate that in &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice the configuration of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; INs network is shifted toward an atypical plasticity state in relevant cortical areas compatible with the sensory-motor dysfunctions characteristics of RTT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A rotation-equivariant convolutional neural network model of primary visual cortex. (arXiv:1809.10504v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Classical models describe primary visual cortex (V1) as a filter bank of
orientation-selective linear-nonlinear (LN) or energy models, but these models
fail to predict neural responses to natural stimuli accurately. Recent work
shows that models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) lead to much
more accurate predictions, but it remains unclear which features are extracted
by V1 neurons beyond orientation selectivity and phase invariance. Here we work
towards systematically studying V1 computations by categorizing neurons into
groups that perform similar computations. We present a framework to identify
common features independent of individual neurons' orientation selectivity by
using a rotation-equivariant convolutional neural network, which automatically
extracts every feature at multiple different orientations. We fit this model to
responses of a population of 6000 neurons to natural images recorded in mouse
primary visual cortex using two-photon imaging. We show that our
rotation-equivariant network not only outperforms a regular CNN with the same
number of feature maps, but also reveals a number of common features shared by
many V1 neurons, which deviate from the typical textbook idea of V1 as a bank
of Gabor filters. Our findings are a first step towards a powerful new tool to
study the nonlinear computations in V1.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Characterizing complex networks using Entropy-degree diagrams: unveiling changes in functional brain connectivity induced by Ayahuasca. (arXiv:1809.10301v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10301</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10301</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Open problems abound in the theory of complex networks, which has found
successful application to diverse fields of science. With the aim of further
advancing the understanding of the brain's functional connectivity, we propose
to evaluate a network metric which we term the geodesic entropy. This entropy,
in a way that can be made precise, quantifies the Shannon entropy of the
distance distribution to a specific node from all other nodes. Measurements of
geodesic entropy allow for the characterization of the structural information
of a network that takes into account the distinct role of each node into the
network topology. The measurement and characterization of this structural
information has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of sustained
activity and other emergent behaviors in networks, such as self-organized
criticality sometimes seen in such contexts. We apply these concepts and
methods to study the effects of how the psychedelic Ayahuasca affects the
functional connectivity of the human brain. We show that the geodesic entropy
is able to differentiate the functional networks of the human brain in two
different states of consciousness in the resting state: (i) the ordinary waking
state and (ii) a state altered by ingestion of the Ayahuasca. The entropy of
the nodes of brain networks from subjects under the influence of Ayahuasca
diverge significantly from those of the ordinary waking state. The functional
brain networks from subjects in the altered state have, on average, a larger
geodesic entropy compared to the ordinary state. We conclude that geodesic
entropy is a useful tool for analyzing complex networks and discuss how and why
it may bring even further valuable insights into the study of the human brain
and other empirical networks.

Biological data sets are typically characterized by high dimensionality and low effect sizes. A powerful method for detecting systematic differences between experimental conditions in such multivariate data sets is multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), particularly pattern classification. However, in virtually all applications, data from the classes that correspond to the conditions of interest are not homogeneous but contain subclasses. Such subclasses can for example arise from individual subjects that contribute multiple data points, or from correlations of items within classes. We show here that in multivariate data that have subclasses nested within its class structure, these subclasses introduce systematic information that improves classifiability beyond what is expected by the size of the class difference. We analytically prove that this subclass bias systematically inflates correct classification rates (CCRs) of linear classifiers depending on the number of subclasses as well as on the portion of variance induced by the subclasses. In simulations, we demonstrate that subclass bias is highest when between-class effect size is low and subclass variance high. This bias can be reduced by increasing the total number of subclasses. However, we can account for the subclass bias by using permutation tests that explicitly consider the subclass structure of the data. We illustrate our result in several experiments that recorded human EEG activity, demonstrating that parametric statistical tests as well as typical trial-wise permutation fail to determine significance of classification outcomes correctly.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tMGb6u-BxMQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Interactions among microbial community members can lead to emergent properties, such as enhanced productivity, stability, and robustness. Iron-oxide mats in acidic (pH 2–4), high-temperature (&amp;gt; 65 °C) springs of Yellowstone National Park contain relatively simple microbial communities and are well-characterized geochemically. Consequently, these communities are excellent model systems for studying the metabolic activity of individual populations and key microbial interactions. The primary goals of the current study were to integrate data collected &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; calculations across process-scales encompassing enzymatic activity, cellular metabolism, community interactions, and ecosystem biogeochemistry, as well as to predict and quantify the functional limits of autotroph-heterotroph interactions. Metagenomic and transcriptomic data were used to reconstruct carbon and energy metabolisms of an important autotroph (&lt;i&gt;Metallosphaera yellowstonensis&lt;/i&gt;) and heterotroph (&lt;i&gt;Geoarchaeum&lt;/i&gt; sp. OSPB) from the studied Fe(III)-oxide mat communities. Standard and hybrid elementary flux mode and flux balance analyses of metabolic models predicted cellular- and community-level metabolic acclimations to simulated environmental stresses, respectively. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; geochemical analyses, including oxygen depth-profiles, Fe(III)-oxide deposition rates, stable carbon isotopes and mat biomass concentrations, were combined with cellular models to explore autotroph-heterotroph interactions important to community structure-function. Integration of metabolic modeling with &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; measurements, including the relative population abundance of autotrophs to heterotrophs, demonstrated that Fe(III)-oxide mat communities operate at their maximum total community growth rate (i.e. sum of autotroph and heterotroph growth rates), as opposed to net community growth rate (i.e. total community growth rate subtracting autotroph consumed by heterotroph), as predicted from the maximum power principle. Integration of multiscale data with ecological theory provides a basis for predicting autotroph-heterotroph interactions and community-level cellular organization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9cziYmlDKfI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Distal dendritic enrichment of HCN1 channels in hippocampal CA1 is promoted by estrogen, but does not require Reelin</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;HCN1 compartmentalization in CA1 pyramidal cells, essential for hippocampal information processing, is believed to be controlled by the extracellular matrix protein Reelin (Kupferman et al., 2014). Expression of Reelin, in turn, is stimulated by 17β-estradiol (E2). In this study, we therefore tested whether E2 regulates the compartmentalization of HCN1 in CA1 via Reelin. In organotypic entorhino-hippocampal cultures, we found that E2 promotes the HCN1 distal dendritic enrichment via the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER1, but apparently independent of Reelin, because GST-RAP, known to reduce reelin signaling, did not prevent E2-induced HCN1 enrichment in distal CA1. We therefore re-examined the role of Reelin for the regulation of HCN1 compartmentalization and could not detect effects of reduced Reelin signaling on HCN1 distribution in CA1, neither in the (developmental) slice culture model, nor in tamoxifen-inducible conditional &lt;i&gt;reelin&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice during adulthood. We conclude that for HCN1 channel compartmentalization in CA1 pyramidal cells, Reelin is not as essential as previously proposed and E2-effects on HCN1 distribution in CA1 are mediated by mechanisms that do not involve Reelin. Because HCN1 localization was not altered at different phases of the estrous cycle, gonadally-derived estradiol is unlikely to regulate HCN1 channel compartmentalization, while the pattern of immunoreactivity of aromatase, the final enzyme of estradiol synthesis, argues for a role of local hippocampal E2 synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Mechanisms of learning and memory require a fine-tuned interplay between ion channels on hippocampal neurons. Among these, CA1 pyramidal cells have a crucial position, as they integrate information from various hippocampal and extra-hippocampal sources. Identifying factors that influence the function of ion channels, such as the HCN1 channels, which filter entorhinal synaptic input, may therefore help to better understand processes that underlie learning and memory. Here we show that the dendritic localization of HCN1 channels, a critical determinant of their function, is influenced by estrogen (E2), thus bringing attention to the modulatory roles of sex hormones on hippocampal information processing, which are yet poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The role of interleukin-10 in mediating the effect of immune challenge on mouse gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons in vivo</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Immune challenge alters neural functioning via cytokine production. Inflammation has profound impact on the central regulation of fertility, but the mechanisms involved are not clearly defined. The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 is responsible for balancing the immune response in the brain. To examine whether IL-10 has an effect on the function of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, we first examined the effect of immune responses with distinct cytokine profiles, such as the T-cell-dependent (TD) and T-cell-independent (TI) B-cell response. We investigated the effect of the TD and TI immune responses on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons by administering fluorescein-isothiocyanate/keyhole-limpet-hemocyanin (KLH-FITC) or dextran-FITC to female mice. Although dextran-FITC had no effect, KLH-FITC induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons after 6 days. KLH-FITC treatment increased the levels of IL-10 in the hypothalamus, but this treatment did not cause lymphocyte infiltration or an increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In IL-10 KO mice, KLH-FITC-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the GnRH neurons was absent. We also showed that in IL-10 KO mice, the estrous cycle was disrupted. Perforated patch-clamp recordings from GnRH-GFP neurons, IL-10 immunohistochemistry and in vitro experiments on acute brain slices revealed that IL-10 can directly alter GnRH neuron firing and induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These observations demonstrate that IL-10 plays a role in influencing signaling of GnRH neurons in the TD immune response. These results also provide the first evidence that IL-10 can directly alter the function of GnRH neurons and may help the maintenance of the integrity of the estrous cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 plays a role in maintaining a balanced immune response in the brain. Although clinical studies have demonstrated that IL-10 influences fertility, the impact of IL-10 on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons is unknown. Our results demonstrate that T cell-dependent (TD) immune challenge induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons via IL-10. We provide the first evidence that IL-10 directly regulates the firing and signaling of GnRH neurons. Our results indicate that IL-10-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons might be associated with the maintenance of the estrous cycle in bacterial/viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The reproducibility of scientific research has become a point of critical
concern. We argue that openness and transparency are critical for
reproducibility, and we outline an ecosystem for open and transparent science
that has emerged within the human neuroimaging community. We discuss the range
of open data sharing resources that have been developed for neuroimaging data,
and the role of data standards (particularly the Brain Imaging Data Structure)
in enabling the automated sharing, processing, and reuse of large neuroimaging
datasets. We outline how the open-source Python language has provided the basis
for a data science platform that enables reproducible data analysis and
visualization. We also discuss how new advances in software engineering, such
as containerization, provide the basis for greater reproducibility in data
analysis. The emergence of this new ecosystem provides an example for many
areas of science that are currently struggling with reproducibility.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding neuronal communication is fundamental in neuroscience but there
are few methodologies offering detailed analysis for well-controlled
conditions. By interfacing microElectrode arrays with microFluidics ({\mu}EF
devices), it is possible to compartmentalize neuronal cultures with a specified
alignment of axons and microelectrodes. This setup allows extracellular
recordings of spike propagation with high signal-to-noise ratio over the course
of several weeks. Addressing these {\mu}EF systems we developed an advanced,
yet easy-to-use, open-source computational tool, {\mu}SpikeHunter, which
provides detailed quantification of several communication-related properties
such as propagation velocity, conduction failure, spike timings, and coding
mechanisms. The combination of {\mu}EF devices and {\mu}SpikeHunter can be used
in the context of standard neuronal cultures or with co-culture configurations
where, for example, communication between sensory neurons and other cell types
is monitored and assessed. The ability to analyze axonal signals (in a
user-friendly, time-efficient, high-throughput manner) opens doors to new
approaches to studies of peripheral innervation, neural coding, and
neuroregeneration approaches, among many others. We demonstrate the use of
{\mu}SpikeHunter in dorsal root ganglion neurons where we analyze the presence
of anterograde signals in {\mu}EF devices.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only major cause of mortality in the world
without an effective disease modifying treatment. Evidence supporting the so
called disconnection hypothesis suggests that functional connectivity
biomarkers may have clinical potential for early detection of AD. However,
known issues with low test-retest reliability and signal to noise in functional
connectivity may prevent accuracy and subsequent predictive capacity. We
validate the utility of a novel principal component based diagnostic
identifiability framework to increase separation in functional connectivity
across the Alzheimer's spectrum by identifying and reconstructing FC using only
AD sensitive components or connectivity modes. We show that this framework (1)
increases test-retest correspondence and (2) allows for better separation, in
functional connectivity, of diagnostic groups both at the whole brain and
individual resting state network level. Finally, we evaluate a posteriori the
association between connectivity mode weights with longitudinal neurocognitive
outcomes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNN) as time-dependent hypotheses consisting of
spiking nodes (neurons) and directed edges (synapses) are believed to offer
unique solutions to reward prediction tasks and the related feedback that are
classified as reinforcement learning. Generally, temporal difference (TD)
learning renders it possible to optimize a model network to predict the delayed
reward in an ad hoc manner. Neuromorphic SNNs--networks built using dedicated
hardware--particularly leverage such TD learning for not only reward prediction
but also temporal sequence prediction in a physical time domain. In this
tutorial, such learning in a physical time domain is referred to as temporal
learning to distinguish it from conventional TD learning-based methods that
generally involve algorithmic (rather than physical) time. This tutorial
addresses neuromorphic SNNs for temporal learning from the scratch. It first
concerns general characteristics of SNNs including spiking neurons and
information coding schemes and then moves on to temporal learning including its
general concept, feasible algorithms, and their association with
neurophysiological learning rules that have intensively been enriched for the
last few decades.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Development of spatial suppression surrounding the focus of visual attention. (arXiv:1809.09700v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09700</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The capacity to filter out irrelevant information from our environment is
critical to efficient processing. Yet, during development, when building a
knowledge base of the world is occurring, the ability to selectively allocate
attentional resources is limited (e.g., Amso &amp;amp; Scerif, 2015). In adulthood,
research has demonstrated that surrounding the spatial location of attentional
focus is a suppressive field, resulting from top-down attention promoting the
processing of relevant stimuli and inhibiting surrounding distractors (e.g.,
Hopf et al., 2006). It is not fully known, however, whether this phenomenon
manifests in development. In the current study, we examined whether spatial
suppression surrounding the focus of visual attention is exhibited in
developmental age groups. Participants between 12 and 27 years of age exhibited
spatial suppression surrounding their focus of visual attention. Their accuracy
increased as a function of the separation distance between a spatially cued
(and attended) target and a second target, suggesting that a ring of
suppression surrounded the attended target. When a central cue was instead
presented and therefore attention was no longer spatially cued, surround
suppression was not observed, indicating that our initial findings of
suppression were indeed related to the focus of attention. Attentional surround
suppression was not observed in 8- to 11-years-olds, even with a longer spatial
cue presentation time, demonstrating that the lack of the effect at these ages
is not due to slowed attentional feedback processes. Our findings demonstrate
that top-down attentional processes are still immature until approximately 12
years of age, and that they continue to be refined throughout adolescence,
converging well with previous research on attentional development.

	<description>Park et al. demonstrate that ASM activity is increased in brain endothelial cells and/or plasma in aged mice, leading to BBB leakage by caveolae-mediated transcytosis via ERM dephosphorylation. Moreover, specific ASM overexpression in brain endothelium accelerates BBB and neuronal dysfunction.</description>

	<description>Kurshan et al. show that a short version of the cell-adhesion molecule neurexin that lacks canonical extracellular domains can nonetheless drive presynaptic assembly. It functions in parallel with the Wnt receptor Frizzled. Wnt eliminates synapses via Frizzled endocytosis and neurexin downregulation.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Farzaneh Khajouei, Saurabh Sinha&lt;/p&gt;

Studying a gene’s regulatory mechanisms is a tedious process that involves identification of candidate regulators by transcription factor (TF) knockout or over-expression experiments, delineation of enhancers by reporter assays, and demonstration of direct TF influence by site mutagenesis, among other approaches. Such experiments are often chosen based on the biologist’s intuition, from several testable hypotheses. We pursue the goal of making this process systematic by using ideas from information theory to reason about experiments in gene regulation, in the hope of ultimately enabling rigorous experiment design strategies. For this, we make use of a state-of-the-art mathematical model of gene expression, which provides a way to formalize our current knowledge of cis- as well as trans- regulatory mechanisms of a gene. Ambiguities in such knowledge can be expressed as uncertainties in the model, which we capture formally by building an ensemble of plausible models that fit the existing data and defining a probability distribution over the ensemble. We then characterize the impact of a new experiment on our understanding of the gene’s regulation based on how the ensemble of plausible models and its probability distribution changes when challenged with results from that experiment. This allows us to assess the ‘value’ of the experiment retroactively as the reduction in entropy of the distribution (information gain) resulting from the experiment’s results. We fully formalize this novel approach to reasoning about gene regulation experiments and use it to evaluate a variety of perturbation experiments on two developmental genes of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We also provide objective and ‘biologist-friendly’ descriptions of the information gained from each such experiment. The rigorously defined information theoretic approaches presented here can be used in the future to formulate systematic strategies for experiment design pertaining to studies of gene regulatory mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z4Q0168x58A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Quantitative single cell analysis uncovers the life/death decision in CD95 network</title>

CD95/Fas/APO-1 is a member of the death receptor family that triggers apoptotic and anti-apoptotic responses in particular, NF-κB. These responses are characterized by a strong heterogeneity within a population of cells. To determine how the cell decides between life and death we developed a computational model supported by imaging flow cytometry analysis of CD95 signaling. Here we show that CD95 stimulation leads to the induction of caspase and NF-kB pathways simultaneously in one cell. The related life/death decision strictly depends on cell-to-cell variability in the formation of the death-inducing complex (DISC) on one side (extrinsic noise) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. stochastic gene expression of the NF-kB pathway on the other side (intrinsic noise). Moreover, our analysis has uncovered that the stochasticity in apoptosis and NF-kB pathways leads not only to survival or death of a cell, but also causes a third type of response to CD95 stimulation that we termed ambivalent response. Cells in the ambivalent state can undergo cell death or survive which was subsequently validated by experiments. Taken together, we have uncovered how these two competing pathways control the fate of a cell, which in turn plays an important role for development of anti-cancer therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fCqyOiqzsjo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Maternal Immune Activation Alters Adult Behavior, Gut Microbiome and Juvenile Brain Oscillations in Ferrets</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Maternal immune activation (MIA) has been identified as a causal factor in psychiatric disorders by epidemiological studies in humans and mechanistic studies in rodent models. Addressing this gap in species between mice and human will accelerate the understanding of the role of MIA in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Here we provide the first study of MIA in the ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;), an animal model with a rich history of developmental investigations due to the similarities in developmental programs and cortical organization with primates. We found that after MIA by injection of PolyIC in the pregnant mother animal, the adult offspring exhibited reduced social behavior, less eye-contact with humans, decreased recognition memory, a sex-specific increase in amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, and altered gut microbiome. We also studied the neurophysiological properties of the MIA ferrets in development by &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings of the local field potential (LFP) from visual cortex in 5-6 weeks old animals, and found that the spontaneous and sensory-evoked LFP had decreased power, especially in the gamma frequency band. Overall, our results provide the first evidence for the detrimental effect of MIA in ferrets support the use of the ferret as an intermediate model species for the study of disorders with neurodevelopmental origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Maternal immune activation (MIA) has been adopted in the rodent model to study neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. Yet, neurodevelopmental programs differ quite substantially between mice and humans. The ferret has a rich history for the study of neurodevelopment due to its unique advantages that combine short gestation time with the emergence of sophisticated cortical organization during development. The present study found that MIA leads to a range of behavioral abnormalities as well as altered gut microbiome in adult ferrets. Notably, we observed impaired brain oscillations in these animals in early development. Our results lay the foundation for the translational study of neurodevelopmental disorders in ferrets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Increased Synthesis of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan Promotes Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Response to Enriched Environment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/39/8496?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) is a candidate regulator of embryonic neurogenesis. The aim of this study was to specify the functional significance of CSPG in adult hippocampal neurogenesis using male mice. Here, we showed that neural stem cells and neuronal progenitors in the dentate gyrus were covered in part by CSPG. Pharmacological depletion of CSPG in the dentate gyrus reduced the densities of neuronal progenitors and newborn granule cells. 3D reconstruction of newborn granule cells showed that their maturation was inhibited by CSPG digestion. The novel object recognition test revealed that CSPG digestion caused cognitive memory impairment. Western blot analysis showed that expression of β-catenin in the dentate gyrus was decreased by CSPG digestion. The amount of CSPG in the dentate gyrus was increased by enriched environment (EE) and was decreased by forced swim stress. In addition, EE accelerated the recovery of CSPG expression in the dentate gyrus from the pharmacological depletion and promoted the restoration of granule cell production. Conversely, the densities of newborn granule cells were also decreased in mice that lacked chondroitin sulfate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 (CSGalNAcT1), a key enzyme for CSPG synthesis (T1KO mice). The capacity of EE to promote granule cell production and improve cognitive memory was impaired in T1KO mice. These findings indicate that CSPG is involved in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and suggest that increased synthesis of CSPG by CSGalNacT1 may mediate promotion of granule cell production and improvement of cognitive memory in response to EE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) is a candidate regulator of embryonic neurogenesis. Here, we specified the role of CSPG in adult neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus. Digestion of CSPG in the dentate gyrus impaired granule cell production and cognitive memory. Enriched environment (EE) promoted the recovery of CSPG expression and granule cell production from the CSPG digestion. Additionally, adult neurogenesis was impaired in mice that lacked a key enzyme for CSPG synthesis (T1KO mice). The capacity of EE to promote granule cell production and cognitive memory was impaired in T1KO mice. Altogether, these findings indicate that CSPG underlies adult hippocampal neurogenesis and suggest that increased synthesis of CSPG may mediate promotion of granule cell production in response to EE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: TRPM2 Exacerbates Central Nervous System Inflammation in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis by Increasing Production of CXCL2 Chemokines</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the CNS characterized by demyelination and axonal injury. Current therapies that mainly target lymphocytes do not fully meet clinical need due to the risk of severe side effects and lack of efficacy against progressive MS. Evidence suggests that MS is associated with CNS inflammation, although the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2), a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable nonselective cation channel, is expressed at high levels in the brain and by immune cells, including monocyte lineage cells. Here, we show that TRPM2 plays a pathological role in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Knockout (KO) or pharmacological inhibition of TRPM2 inhibited progression of EAE and TRPM2-KO mice showed lower activation of Iba1-immunopositive monocyte lineage cells and neutrophil infiltration of the CNS than WT mice. Moreover, CXCL2 production in TRPM2-KO mice was significantly reduced at day 14, although the severity of EAE was the same as that in WT mice at that time point. In addition, we used BM chimeric mice to show that TRPM2 expressed by CNS-infiltrating macrophages contributes to progression of EAE. Because CXCL2 induces migration of neutrophils, these results indicate that reduced expression of CXCL2 in the CNS suppresses neutrophil infiltration and slows progression of EAE in TRPM2-KO mice. Together, the results suggest that TRPM2 plays an important role in progression of EAE pathology and shed light on its putative role as a therapeutic target for MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Current therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS), which mainly target lymphocytes, carry the risk of severe side effects and lack efficacy against the progressive form of the disease. Here, we found that the transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel, which is abundantly expressed in CNS-infiltrating macrophages, plays a crucial role in development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. EAE progression was suppressed by Knockout (KO) or pharmacological inhibition of TRPM2; this was attributed to a reduction in CXCL2 chemokine production by CNS-infiltrating macrophages in TRPM2-KO mice, resulting in suppression of neutrophil infiltration into the CNS. These results reveal an important role of TRPM2 in the pathogenesis of EAE and shed light on its potential as a therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Comparison of fluctuations in global network topology of modeled and empirical brain functional connectivity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Makoto Fukushima, Olaf Sporns&lt;/p&gt;

Dynamic models of large-scale brain activity have been used for reproducing many empirical findings on human brain functional connectivity. Features that have been shown to be reproducible by comparing modeled to empirical data include functional connectivity measured over several minutes of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, as well as its time-resolved fluctuations on a time scale of tens of seconds. However, comparison of modeled and empirical data has not been conducted yet for fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity, such as fluctuations between segregated and integrated topology or between high and low modularity topology. Since these global network-level fluctuations have been shown to be related to human cognition and behavior, there is an emerging need for clarifying their reproducibility with computational models. To address this problem, we directly compared fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity between modeled and empirical data, and clarified the degree to which a stationary model of spontaneous brain dynamics can reproduce the empirically observed fluctuations. Modeled fluctuations were simulated using a system of coupled phase oscillators wired according to brain structural connectivity. By performing model parameter search, we found that modeled fluctuations in global metrics quantifying network integration and modularity had more than 80% of magnitudes of those observed in the empirical data. Temporal properties of network states determined based on fluctuations in these metrics were also found to be reproducible, although their spatial patterns in functional connectivity did not perfectly matched. These results suggest that stationary models simulating resting-state activity can reproduce the magnitude of empirical fluctuations in segregation and integration, whereas additional factors, such as active mechanisms controlling non-stationary dynamics and/or greater accuracy of mapping brain structural connectivity, would be necessary for fully reproducing the spatial patterning associated with these fluctuations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sr-8OBw5Vvo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cooperation is key for the evolution of biological systems ranging from bacteria communities to human societies. Evolutionary processes can dramatically alter the cooperation level. Evolutionary processes are typically of two classes: comparison based and self-evaluation based. The fate of cooperation is extremely sensitive to the details of comparison based processes. For self-evaluation processes, however, it is still unclear whether the sensitivity remains. We concentrate on a class of self-evaluation processes based on aspiration, where all the individuals adjust behaviors based on their own aspirations. We prove that the evolutionary outcome with heterogeneous aspirations is the same as that of the homogeneous one for regular networks under weak selection limit. Simulation results further suggest that it is also valid for general networks across various distributions of personalised aspirations. Our result clearly indicates that self-evaluation processes are robust in contrast with comparison based rules. In addition, our result greatly simplifies the calculation of the aspiration dynamics, which is computationally expensive.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AtRjHXVAAl8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Electrophysiological Signature Reveals Laminar Structure of the Porcine Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0102-18.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is integral to working and episodic memory and is a central region of interest in diseases affecting these processes. Pig models are widely used in translational research and may provide an excellent bridge between rodents and nonhuman primates for CNS disease models because of their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. However, the laminar structure of the pig hippocampus has not been well characterized. Therefore, we histologically characterized the dorsal hippocampus of Yucatan miniature pigs and quantified the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal layers. We then utilized stereotaxis combined with single-unit electrophysiological mapping to precisely place multichannel laminar silicon probes into the dorsal hippocampus without the need for image guidance. We used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological recordings of simultaneous laminar field potentials and single-unit activity in multiple layers of the dorsal hippocampus to physiologically identify and quantify these layers under anesthesia. Consistent with previous reports, we found the porcine hippocampus to have the expected archicortical laminar structure, with some anatomical and histological features comparable to the rodent and others to the primate hippocampus. Importantly, we found these distinct features to be reflected in the laminar electrophysiology. This characterization, as well as our electrophysiology-based methodology targeting the porcine hippocampal lamina combined with high-channel-count silicon probes, will allow for analysis of spike-field interactions during normal and disease states in both anesthetized and future awake behaving neurophysiology in this large animal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: OptMDFpathway: Identification of metabolic pathways with maximal thermodynamic driving force and its application for analyzing the endogenous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation potential of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Oliver Hädicke, Axel von Kamp, Timur Aydogan, Steffen Klamt&lt;/p&gt;

Constraint-based modeling techniques have become a standard tool for the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of metabolic networks. To further improve their accuracy, recent methodological developments focused on integration of thermodynamic information in metabolic models to assess the feasibility of flux distributions by thermodynamic driving forces. Here we present &lt;i&gt;OptMDFpathway&lt;/i&gt;, a method that extends the recently proposed framework of Max-min Driving Force (MDF) for thermodynamic pathway analysis. Given a metabolic network model, &lt;i&gt;OptMDFpathway&lt;/i&gt; identifies both the optimal MDF for a desired phenotypic behavior as well as the respective pathway itself that supports the optimal driving force. &lt;i&gt;OptMDFpathway&lt;/i&gt; is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and is applicable to genome-scale metabolic networks. As an important theoretical result, we also show that there exists always at least one elementary mode in the network that reaches the maximal MDF. We employed our new approach to systematically identify all substrate-product combinations in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; where product synthesis allows for concomitant net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assimilation via thermodynamically feasible pathways. Although biomass synthesis cannot be coupled to net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; we found that as many as 145 of the 949 cytosolic carbon metabolites contained in the genome-scale model &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;JO1366 enable net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; incorporation along thermodynamically feasible pathways with glycerol as substrate and 34 with glucose. The most promising products in terms of carbon assimilation yield and thermodynamic driving forces are orotate, aspartate and the C4-metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. We also identified thermodynamic bottlenecks frequently limiting the maximal driving force of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing pathways. Our results indicate that heterotrophic organisms like &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; hold a possibly underestimated potential for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assimilation which may complement existing biotechnological approaches for capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, we envision that the developed &lt;i&gt;OptMDFpathway&lt;/i&gt; approach can be used for many other applications within the framework of constrained-based modeling and for rational design of metabolic networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4gUy88yqGt0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: December 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Shannon K Rich, Jonathan R Terman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how neurons form, extend, and navigate their finger-like axonal and dendritic processes is crucial for developing therapeutics for the diseased and damaged brain. Although less well appreciated, many other types of cells also send out similar finger-like projections. Indeed, unlike neuronal specific phenomena such as synapse formation or synaptic transmission, an important issue for thought is that this critical long-standing question of how a cellular process like an axon or dendrite forms and extends is not primarily a neuroscience problem but a cell biological problem. In that case, the use of simple cellular processes — such as the bristle cell process of Drosophila — can aid in the fight to answer these critical questions. Specifically, determining how a model cellular process is generated can provide a framework for manipulations of all types of membranous process-containing cells, including different types of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Systematic analysis of transmitter co-expression reveals organizing principles of local interneuron heterogeneity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0212-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0212-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Broad neuronal classes are surprisingly heterogeneous across many parameters and sub-classes often exhibit partially overlapping traits including transmitter co-expression. However, the extent to which transmitter co-expression occurs in predictable, consistent patterns is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that pairwise co-expression of GABA and multiple neuropeptide families by olfactory local interneurons (LNs) of the moth &lt;i&gt;Manduca sexta&lt;/i&gt; is highly heterogeneous, with a single LN capable of expressing neuropeptides from at least four peptide families and few instances in which neuropeptides are consistently co-expressed. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that observed co-expression patterns cannot be explained by independent probabilities of expression of each neuropeptide. Our analyses point to three organizing principles that once taken into consideration allow replication of overall co-expression structure: 1- peptidergic neurons are highly likely to -co-express GABA; 2- expression probability of Allatotropin depends upon Myoinhibitory peptide expression; 3- the all-or-none co-expression patterns of Tachykinin neurons with several other neuropeptides. For other peptide pairs, the presence of one peptide was not predictive of the presence of the other and co-expression probability could be replicated by independent probabilities. The stochastic nature of these co-expression patterns highlights the heterogeneity of transmitter content among LNs and argues against clear-cut definition of subpopulation types based on the presence of &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; neuropeptides. Furthermore, the receptors for all neuropeptides and GABA were expressed within each population of principal neuron type in the AL. Thus, activation of any given LN results in a dynamic cocktail of modulators that have the potential to influence every level of olfactory processing within the AL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the functional roles of individual local interneurons (LNs) is complex because traits, like transmitter co-expression, are often partially overlapping across the population. Here, we find that single olfactory LNs co-express neuropeptides from at least four individual peptide families, and that GABA and neuropeptides are partially and heterogeneously co-expressed across the entire population. The stochastic nature of many observed co-expression patterns argues against clear-cut and exclusive definition of subpopulations based on the expression of &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; neuropeptides. Overall, our results suggest that activation of any given LN causes the release of a variable combination of neuropeptides and GABA that, based on receptor expression, target the input, output and local processing stages of the olfactory coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Intrinsic plasticity is expressed in virtually all neuronal types including principal cells and interneurons. Activation of synaptic glutamate receptors initiates long-lasting changes in neuronal excitability at presynaptic and postsynaptic side. As synaptic plasticity, intrinsic plasticity is bi-directional and expresses a certain level of input-specificity or cell-specificity. We discuss here the nature of the learning rules shared by intrinsic and synaptic plasticity and the impact of intrinsic plasticity on temporal processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The attenuation of either maintenance or plasticity leads to impaired circuit function and ultimately to neurodegenerative disorders. Over the last few years, significant discoveries of molecular mechanisms were made that mediate the formation and maintenance of axons. Here, we highlight intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that ensure the health and survival of axons. We also briefly discuss examples of mutations associated with impaired axonal maintenance identified in specific neurological conditions. A better understanding of these mechanisms will therefore help to define targets for therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Distinctive Structural and Molecular Features of Myelinated Inhibitory Axons in Human Neocortex</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Numerous types of inhibitory neurons sculpt the performance of human neocortical circuits, with each type exhibiting a constellation of subcellular phenotypic features in support of its specialized functions. Axonal myelination has been absent among the characteristics used to distinguish inhibitory neuron types; in fact, very little is known about myelinated inhibitory axons in human neocortex. Here, using array tomography to analyze samples of neurosurgically excised human neocortex, we show that inhibitory myelinated axons originate predominantly from parvalbumin-containing interneurons. Compared to myelinated excitatory axons, they have higher neurofilament and lower microtubule content, shorter nodes of Ranvier, and more myelin basic protein in their myelin sheath. Furthermore, these inhibitory axons have more mitochondria, likely to sustain the high energy demands of parvalbumin interneurons, as well as more 2’,3’-cyclic nucleotide 3’-phosphodiesterase, a protein enriched in the myelin cytoplasmic channels that are thought to facilitate the delivery of nutrients from ensheathing oligodendrocytes. Our results demonstrate that myelinated axons of parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons exhibit distinctive features that may support the specialized functions of this neuron type in human neocortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Numerous myelinated axons traverse the human neocortex, enabling fast and efficient signal transmission. Myelinated axons originate from both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but their properties have rarely been studied in relation to parent neuron type. Here, we show that axons of inhibitory neurons have distinctive structural and molecular features that contrast with those of the majority of excitatory myelinated axons in human neocortex. These differences are likely to have important implications for neurological disorders that involve pathologies of myelinated axons. For example, the distinct molecular and structural organization of inhibitory and excitatory myelinated axons may underlie differences in their vulnerability in neurological disorders or to injuries, and may require different strategies for prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sniffing fast: paradoxical effects on odor concentration discrimination at the levels of olfactory bulb output and behavior</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In awake mice, sniffing behavior is subject to complex contextual modulation. It has been hypothesized that variance in inhalation dynamics alters odor concentration profiles in the naris despite a constant environmental concentration. Using whole cell recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice, we directly demonstrate that rapid sniffing mimics the effect of odor concentration increase at the level of both mitral and tufted cell (MTC) firing rate responses and temporal responses. Paradoxically, we find that mice are capable of discriminating fine concentration differences within short timescales despite highly variable sniffing behavior. One way that the olfactory system could differentiate between a change in sniffing and a change in concentration would be to receive information about the inhalation parameters in parallel with information about the odor. We find that the sniff-driven activity of MTCs without odor input is informative of the kind of inhalation that just occurred, allowing rapid detection of a change in inhalation. Thus, a possible reason for sniff modulation of the early olfactory system may be to directly inform downstream centres of nasal flow dynamics, so that an inference can be made about environmental concentration independent of sniff variance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; One of the fundamental tasks of the brain is to represent the features of the environment in a stable way. In the olfactory system, it has been hypothesized that changing the way you sniff will alter the concentration of odor coming into the nasal passage, even though the environmental concentration has not changed. Here we show that indeed, the effect of faster sniffing on olfactory bulb responses is very similar to increasing odor concentration. Despite this, mice can easily tell the difference between a change in sniffing and a change in concentration in an olfactory task. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we suggest and give evidence for ways in which olfactory bulb information about sniffing parameters may be utilised.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
