	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fast amortized inference of neural activity from calcium imaging data with variational autoencoders. (arXiv:1711.01846v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01846</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01846</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging permits optical measurement of neural activity. Since
intracellular calcium concentration is an indirect measurement of neural
activity, computational tools are necessary to infer the true underlying
spiking activity from fluorescence measurements. Bayesian model inversion can
be used to solve this problem, but typically requires either computationally
expensive MCMC sampling, or faster but approximate maximum-a-posteriori
optimization. Here, we introduce a flexible algorithmic framework for fast,
efficient and accurate extraction of neural spikes from imaging data. Using the
framework of variational autoencoders, we propose to amortize inference by
training a deep neural network to perform model inversion efficiently. The
recognition network is trained to produce samples from the posterior
distribution over spike trains. Once trained, performing inference amounts to a
fast single forward pass through the network, without the need for iterative
optimization or sampling. We show that amortization can be applied flexibly to
a wide range of nonlinear generative models and significantly improves upon the
state of the art in computation time, while achieving competitive accuracy. Our
framework is also able to represent posterior distributions over spike-trains.
We demonstrate the generality of our method by proposing the first
probabilistic approach for separating backpropagating action potentials from
putative synaptic inputs in calcium imaging of dendritic spines.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Kurt Lewin, psychological constructs and sources of brain cognitive activity. (arXiv:1711.01767v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding mind-brain-environment relations is one of the key topics in
psychology. Kurt Lewin, inspired by theoretical physics, tried to establish
topological and vector psychology analyzing patterns of interaction between the
individual and her/his environment. The time is ripe to reformulate his
ambitious goals, searching for ways to interpret objectively measured brain
processes in terms of suitable psychological constructs. Connecting cognitive
and social psychology constructs to neurophenomics, as it is done now in
psychiatry, should ground them in physical reality.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Mutual Information in Frequency and its Application to Measure Cross-Frequency Coupling in Epilepsy. (arXiv:1711.01629v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01629</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01629</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We define a novel metric, mutual information in frequency (MI-in-frequency),
to detect and quantify the statistical dependence between different frequency
components in the data and apply it to electrophysiological recordings from the
brain to infer cross-frequency coupling. The current metrics used to quantify
the cross-frequency coupling in neuroscience cannot detect statistical
independence in frequency between nonlinear recordings. Our MI-in-frequency
metric, based on Shannon's mutual information between the Cram\'{e}r's
representation of stochastic processes, overcomes this shortcoming. We describe
two data-driven estimators of MI-in-frequency: one based on kernel density
estimation and the other based on the nearest neighbor algorithm and validate
their performance on linear and nonlinear models. We then use MI-in-frequency
to estimate mutual information between two data streams that are dependent
across time, without making parametric model assumptions. Finally, we use the
MI-in-frequency metric to investigate the cross-frequency coupling in seizure
onset zone from electrocorticographic recordings during seizures. The inferred
cross-frequency coupling characteristics are essential to optimize the spatial
and spectral parameters of electrical stimulation based treatments of epilepsy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a class of stochastic models of interacting neurons
with emergent dynamics similar to those seen in local cortical populations, and
compares them to very simple reduced models driven by the same mean excitatory
and inhibitory currents. Discrepancies in firing rates between network and
reduced models were investigated, and mechanisms leading to these discrepancies
were identified. Chief among them is correlations in spiking, or partial
synchronization, working in concert with &quot;nonlinearities&quot; in the time evolution
of membrane potentials. Additionally, simple random walk models and their first
passage times were shown to reproduce well fluctuations in neuronal membrane
potentials and interspike times.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, it is possible to record the activity of hundreds of cells at the
same time in behaving animals. However, these data are often treated and
analyzed as if they consisted of many independently recorded neurons. How can
neuronal populations be uniquely used to learn about cognition? We describe
recent work that shows that populations of simultaneously recorded neurons are
fundamental to understand the basis of decision-making, including processes
such as ongoing deliberations and decision confidence, which generally fall
outside the reach of single-cell analysis. Thus, neuronal population data allow
addressing novel questions, but they also come with so far unsolved challenges.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multiplicative and additive modulation of neuronal tuning with population activity affects encoded information. (arXiv:1711.01421v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have shown that neuronal responses are modulated by stimulus
properties, and also by the state of the local network. However, little is
known about how activity fluctuations of neuronal populations modulate the
sensory tuning of cells and affect their encoded information. We found that
fluctuations in ongoing and stimulus-evoked population activity in primate
visual cortex modulate the tuning of neurons in a multiplicative and additive
manner. While distributed on a continuum, neurons with stronger multiplicative
effects tended to have less additive modulation, and vice versa. The
information encoded by multiplicatively-modulated neurons increased with
greater population activity, while that of additively-modulated neurons
decreased. These effects offset each other, so that population activity had
little effect on total information. Our results thus suggest that intrinsic
activity fluctuations may act as a &quot;traffic light&quot; that determines which subset
of neurons are most informative.

Prediction of RNA tertiary structure from sequence is an important problem, but generating accurate structure models for even short sequences remains difficult. Predictions of RNA tertiary structure tend to be least accurate in loop regions, where non-canonical pairs are important for determining the details of structure. Non-canonical pairs can be predicted using a knowledge-based model of structure that scores nucleotide cyclic motifs, or NCMs. In this work, a partition function algorithm is introduced that allows the estimation of base pairing probabilities for both canonical and non-canonical interactions. Pairs that are predicted to be probable are more likely to be found in the true structure than pairs of lower probability. Pair probability estimates can be further improved by predicting the structure conserved across multiple homologous sequences using the TurboFold algorithm. These pairing probabilities, used in concert with prior knowledge of the canonical secondary structure, allow accurate inference of non-canonical pairs, an important step towards accurate prediction of the full tertiary structure. Software to predict non-canonical base pairs and pairing probabilities is now provided as part of the RNAstructure software package.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J5YsnnWYYZg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

New promising avenues for the pharmacological treatment of skeletal and heart muscle diseases rely on direct sarcomeric modulators, which are molecules that can directly bind to sarcomeric proteins and either inhibit or enhance their activity. A recent breakthrough has been the discovery of the myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil (OM), which has been shown to increase the power output of the cardiac muscle and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure. While the overall effect of OM on the mechano-chemical cycle of myosin is to increase the fraction of myosin molecules in the sarcomere that are strongly bound to actin, the molecular basis of its action is still not completely clear. We present here a Molecular Dynamics study of the motor domain of human cardiac myosin bound to OM, where the effects of the drug on the dynamical properties of the protein are investigated for the first time with atomistic resolution. We found that OM has a double effect on myosin dynamics, inducing a) an increased coupling of the motions of the converter and lever arm subdomains to the rest of the protein and b) a rewiring of the network of dynamic correlations, which produces preferential communication pathways between the OM binding site and distant functional regions. The location of the residues responsible for these effects suggests possible strategies for the future development of improved drugs and the targeting of specific cardiomyopathy-related mutations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9Z_oilE7eOc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Insight into glucocorticoid receptor signalling through interactome model analysis</title>

Glucocorticoid hormones (GCs) are used to treat a variety of diseases because of their potent anti-inflammatory effect and their ability to induce apoptosis in lymphoid malignancies through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Despite ongoing research, high glucocorticoid efficacy and widespread usage in medicine, resistance, disease relapse and toxicity remain factors that need addressing. Understanding the mechanisms of glucocorticoid signalling and how resistance may arise is highly important towards improving therapy. To gain insight into this we undertook a systems biology approach, aiming to generate a Boolean model of the glucocorticoid receptor protein interaction network that encapsulates functional relationships between the GR, its target genes or genes that target GR, and the interactions between the genes that interact with the GR. This model named GEB052 consists of 52 nodes representing genes or proteins, the model input (GC) and model outputs (cell death and inflammation), connected by 241 logical interactions of activation or inhibition. 323 changes in the relationships between model constituents following &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; knockouts were uncovered, and steady-state analysis followed by cell-based microarray genome-wide model validation led to an average of 57% correct predictions, which was taken further by assessment of model predictions against patient microarray data. Lastly, semi-quantitative model analysis via microarray data superimposed onto the model with a score flow algorithm has also been performed, which demonstrated significantly higher correct prediction ratios (average of 80%), and the model has been assessed as a predictive clinical tool using published patient microarray data. In summary we present an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; simulation of the glucocorticoid receptor interaction network, linked to downstream biological processes that can be analysed to uncover relationships between GR and its interactants. Ultimately the model provides a platform for future development both by directing laboratory research and allowing for incorporation of further components, encapsulating more interactions/genes involved in glucocorticoid receptor signalling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OQTHoGXLIUY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A number of neurological disorders arise from perturbations in biochemical signaling and protein complex formation within neurons. Normally, proteins form networks that when activated produce persistent changes in a synapse’s molecular composition. In hippocampal neurons, calcium ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) flux through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors activates Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin signal transduction networks that either increase or decrease the strength of the neuronal synapse, phenomena known as long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), respectively. The calcium-sensor calmodulin (CaM) acts as a common activator of the networks responsible for both LTP and LTD. This is possible, in part, because CaM binding proteins are “tuned” to different Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux signals by their unique binding and activation dynamics. Computational modeling is used to describe the binding and activation dynamics of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/CaM signal transduction and can be used to guide focused experimental studies. Although CaM binds over 100 proteins, practical limitations cause many models to include only one or two CaM-activated proteins. In this work, we view Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/CaM as a limiting resource in the signal transduction pathway owing to its low abundance relative to its binding partners. With this view, we investigate the effect of competitive binding on the dynamics of CaM binding partner activation. Using an explicit model of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, CaM, and seven highly-expressed hippocampal CaM binding proteins, we find that competition for CaM binding serves as a tuning mechanism: the presence of competitors shifts and sharpens the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; frequency-dependence of CaM binding proteins. Notably, we find that simulated competition may be sufficient to recreate the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; frequency dependence of the CaM-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Additionally, competition alone (without feedback mechanisms or spatial parameters) could replicate counter-intuitive experimental observations of decreased activation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/CaM-dependent protein kinase II in knockout models of neurogranin. We conclude that competitive tuning could be an important dynamic process underlying synaptic plasticity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/faxjg4QPtgI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Individual versus superensemble forecasts of seasonal influenza outbreaks in the United States</title>

Recent research has produced a number of methods for forecasting seasonal influenza outbreaks. However, differences among the predicted outcomes of competing forecast methods can limit their use in decision-making. Here, we present a method for reconciling these differences using Bayesian model averaging. We generated retrospective forecasts of peak timing, peak incidence, and total incidence for seasonal influenza outbreaks in 48 states and 95 cities using 21 distinct forecast methods, and combined these individual forecasts to create weighted-average superensemble forecasts. We compared the relative performance of these individual and superensemble forecast methods by geographic location, timing of forecast, and influenza season. We find that, overall, the superensemble forecasts are more accurate than any individual forecast method and less prone to producing a poor forecast. Furthermore, we find that these advantages increase when the superensemble weights are stratified according to the characteristics of the forecast or geographic location. These findings indicate that different competing influenza prediction systems can be combined into a single more accurate forecast product for operational delivery in real time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/18cFjFSdHnk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We first review previous computational accounts of addiction, focusing on cocaine addiction and on prevalent dopamine-based positive-reinforcement and negative-reinforcement computational models. Then, we discuss a recent computational proposal that the progression to addiction is unlikely to result from a complete withdrawal of the goal-oriented decision system in favor the habitual one. Rather, the transition to addiction would arise from a drug-induced alteration in the structure of organismal needs which reorganizes the goal structure, ultimately favoring predominance of drug-oriented goals. Finally, we outline unmet challenges for future computational research on addiction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

While this division is not clear-cut, we argue that these approaches should be much more intimately linked. From a Bayesian perspective, computational theories provide constrained prior distributions on neural data—albeit highly sophisticated ones. By connecting theory to observation via a probabilistic model, we provide the link necessary to test, evaluate, and revise our theories in a data-driven and statistically rigorous fashion. This review highlights examples of this theory-driven pipeline for neural data analysis in recent literature and illustrates it with a worked example based on the temporal difference learning model of dopamine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During development, glia keep neuronal cell numbers in check and ensure that mature neural circuits are appropriately sculpted by engulfing superfluous cells and projections. In the adult brain, glial cells offer metabolic sustenance and provide critical immune support in the face of acute and chronic challenges. Dysfunctional glial immune activity is believed to contribute to age-related cognitive decline, as well as neurodegenerative disease risk, but we still know surprisingly little about the specific molecular pathways that govern glia-neuron communication in the healthy or diseased brain. Drosophila offers a versatile in vivo model to explore the conserved molecular underpinnings of glial cell biology and glial cell contributions to brain function, health, and disease susceptibility. This review addresses recent findings describing how Drosophila glial cells influence neuronal activity in the adult fly brain to support optimal brain function and, importantly, highlights new insights into specific glial defects that may contribute to neuronal demise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Sebastian   Werneburg, Philip A   Feinberg, Kasey M   Johnson, Dorothy P   Schafer&lt;br /&gt; Microglia have recently been recognized as key regulators of synapse development, function, and plasticity. Critical to progressing the field is the identification of molecular underpinnings necessary for microglia to carry out these important functions within neural circuits. Here, we focus a review specifically on roles for microglial cytokine signaling within developing and mature neural circuits. We review exciting new studies demonstrating essential roles for microglial cytokine signaling in axon outgrowth, synaptogenesis and synapse maturation during development, as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity in adulthood. Together, these studies identify microglia and cytokines as critical modulators of neural circuits within the healthy brain, with implications for a broad range of neurological disorders with disruptions in synaptic structure and function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095943881730137X-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Motor BMIs, for instance, re-route neural activity to control movements of a new effector and could restore movement to people with paralysis. Increasing experience shows that interfacing with the brain inevitably changes the brain. BMIs engage and depend on a wide array of innate learning mechanisms to produce meaningful behavior. BMIs precisely define the information streams into and out of the brain, but engage wide-spread learning. We take a network perspective and review existing observations of learning in motor BMIs to show that BMIs engage multiple learning mechanisms distributed across neural networks. Recent studies demonstrate the advantages of BMI for parsing this learning and its underlying neural mechanisms. BMIs therefore provide a powerful tool for studying the neural mechanisms of learning that highlights the critical role of learning in engineered neural therapies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The morphological and molecular heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors point to functions beyond establishing saltatory nerve conduction. Here, we review the diversity in the oligodendroglial lineage as well as the classical and new functions identified for oligodendrocytes and their progenitors. Because oligodendroglia remain highly responsive to environmental changes, they likely contribute to various neurological and psychiatric diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

For a population of neurons encoding a single circular variable with such canonical tuning curves, computing a simple population vector is the optimal read-out of the most likely stimulus. We argue that the advantages of population vector read-outs are so compelling that even the neural representation of the outside world's flat Euclidean geometry is curled up into a torus (a circle times a circle), creating the hexagonal activity patterns of mammalian grid cells. Here, the circular scale is not set a priori, so the nervous system can use multiple scales and gain fields to overcome the ambiguity inherent in periodic representations of linear variables. We review the experimental evidence for this framework and discuss its testable predictions and generalizations to more abstract grid-like neural representations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent work suggests that they play a key role in regulating brain energy supply by increasing blood flow to regions where neurons are active, and setting the baseline level of blood flow. Controversy persists over whether lactate derived from astrocyte glycolysis is used to power oxidative phosphorylation in neurons, but astrocytes sustain neuronal ATP production by recycling neurotransmitter glutamate that would otherwise need to be resynthesised from glucose, and by providing a short-term energy store in the form of glycogen that can be mobilised when neurons are active. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To achieve these precise shapes, glia and neurons exhibit coordinated morphological changes on the time scale of minutes and on size scales ranging from nanometers to hundreds of microns. Here, we review recent studies that reveal the highly dynamic, localized morphological changes of mammalian neuron–glia contacts. We then explore the power of Drosophila and C. elegans models to study coordinated changes at defined neuron–glia contacts, highlighting the use of innovative genetic and imaging tools to uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinated morphogenesis of neurons and glia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Derived from the yolk sac during development, microglia self-renew, self-regulate their numbers during homeostatic conditions, and show a robust proliferative capacity even in adulthood. Together with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), microglia coordinate the regeneration of CNS myelin around axons, termed remyelination. Gene expression analyses and experimental modelling have identified pro-remyelination roles for microglia/MDM in clearance of myelin debris, secretion of growth factors, and remodelling of the extracellular matrix. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms controlling these regenerative functions will reveal novel therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination, by harnessing the beneficial effects of the innate immune response to injury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, microglia enter the brain during embryogenesis and recent studies have revealed additional early functions of these immune cells in prenatal and perinatal cerebral development. Such findings are of importance since prenatal inflammation and microglia dysfunction have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. This review provides a selective overview of the early roles of microglia, their link with a specific spatiotemporal distribution and how they can be modulated by intrinsic factors or environmental signals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: October 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 46&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Jacopo   Bono, Katharina A   Wilmes, Claudia   Clopath&lt;br /&gt; One of the key questions in neuroscience is how our brain self-organises to efficiently process information. To answer this question, we need to understand the underlying mechanisms of plasticity and their role in shaping synaptic connectivity. Theoretical neuroscience typically investigates plasticity on the level of neural networks. Neural network models often consist of point neurons, completely neglecting neuronal morphology for reasons of simplicity. However, during the past decades it became increasingly clear that inputs are locally processed in the dendrites before they reach the cell body. Dendritic properties enable local interactions between synapses and location-dependent modulations of inputs, rendering the position of synapses on dendrites highly important. These insights changed our view of neurons, such that we now think of them as small networks of nearly independent subunits instead of a simple point. Here, we propose that understanding how the brain processes information strongly requires that we consider the following properties: which plasticity mechanisms are present in the dendrites and how do they enable the self-organisation of synapses across the dendritic tree for efficient information processing? Ultimately, dendritic plasticity mechanisms can be studied in networks of neurons with dendrites, possibly uncovering unknown mechanisms that shape the connectivity in our brains. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Tessa   Johung, Michelle   Monje&lt;br /&gt; Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor and high-grade gliomas the leading cause of brain tumor-related death in both children and adults. An appreciation for the crucial role of the nervous system in the tumor microenvironment is emerging for cancers in general, and the neural regulation of glioma progression has come into sharp focus. Here, we review what is known about the influence of active neurons on glioma pathobiology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

As models relating to basal ganglia dysfunction have proliferated, however, there has not always been consistency among their findings. This work points out several ways in which biological details, relating to ionic currents and synaptic pathways, can influence the dynamics of models of the basal ganglia under parkinsonian conditions and hence may be important for inclusion in models. It also suggests some additional useful directions for future modeling studies relating to basal ganglia dysfunction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

In contrast, most humanoid robots in the DARPA Robotics Challenge fell down to ground. The dramatic contrast in performance is mainly due to differences in the amount of training data, which is huge and small, respectively. Animals are not allowed with millions of the failed trials, which lead to injury and death. Humans fall only several thousand times before they balance and walk. We hypothesize that a unique closed-loop neural circuit formed by the Purkinje cells, the cerebellar deep nucleus and the inferior olive in and around the cerebellum and the highest density of gap junctions, which regulate synchronous activities of the inferior olive nucleus, are computational machinery for learning from a small sample. We discuss recent experimental and computational advances associated with this hypothesis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Conversely, there is increasing evidence that brain ischemia can cause cardiac dysfunction. The mechanisms underlying this neurogenic heart disease are incompletely understood. Although it is established that ischemic stroke is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial damage, elevated cardiac enzymes, and plasma catecholamines in the acute phase, nothing is known about the delayed consequences of ischemic stroke on cardiovascular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Finally, animals were treated with metoprolol to evaluate a pharmacologic treatment option to prevent the development of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25073-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focal cerebral ischemia induced a long-term cardiac dysfunction with a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and an increase in left ventricular volumes; this development was associated with higher peripheral sympathetic activity. Metoprolol treatment prevented the development of chronic cardiac dysfunction by decelerating extracellular cardiac remodeling and inhibiting sympathetic signaling relevant to chronic autonomic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25073-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focal cerebral ischemia in mice leads to the development of chronic systolic dysfunction driven by increased sympathetic activity. If these results can be confirmed in a clinical setting, treating physicians should be attentive to clinical signs of heart failure in every patient after ischemic stroke. Therapeutically, the successful β-blockade with metoprolol in mice could also have future clinical implications. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Physiological Tremor Increases when Skeletal Muscle is Shortened: Implications for Fusimotor Control. (arXiv:1711.00928v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00928</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The involuntary force fluctuations associated with physiological (as distinct
from pathological) tremor are an unavoidable component of human motor control.
While the origins of the physiological tremor are known to depend on muscle
afferentation, it is possible that the mechanical properties of muscle-tendon
systems also affect its generation, amplification and maintenance. In this
paper, we investigated the dependence of physiological tremor during tonic,
isometric plantarflextion torque at 30% of maximum at three ankle angles. The
amplitude of physiological tremor increased as calf muscles shortened in
contrast to the stretch reflex whose amplitude decreases as muscle shortens. We
used a closed-loop simulation model of afferented muscle to explore the
mechanisms responsible for this behavior. We demonstrate that changing muscle
lengths does not suffice to explain our experimental findings. Rather, the
model consistently required the modulation of gamme-static fusimotor drive to
produce increases in physiological tremor with muscle shortening--while
successfully replicating the concomitant reduction in stretch reflex amplitude.
This need to control gamma-static fusimotor drive explicitly as a function of
muscle length has important implication. First, it permits the amplitudes of
physiological tremor and stretch reflex to be decoupled. Second, it postulates
neuromechanical interaction that require length-dependent gamma drive
modulation to be independent from alpha drive to the parent muscle. Lastly, it
suggests that physiological tremor can be used as a simple, non-invasive
measure of the afferent mechanisms underlying healthy motor function, and their
disruption in neurological conditions.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data for imaginary and real colours in grapheme-colour synaesthesia</title>

	<description>Grapheme-colour synaesthesia is a subjective phenomenon related to perception and imagination, in which some people involuntarily but systematically associate specific, idiosyncratic colours to achromatic letters or digits. Its investigation is relevant to unravel the neural correlates of colour perception in isolation from low-level neural processing of spectral components, as well as the neural correlates of imagination by being able to reliably trigger imaginary colour experiences. However, functional MRI studies using univariate analyses failed to provide univocal evidence of the activation of the &quot;colour network&quot; by synaesthesia. Applying Multivariate (multivoxel) Pattern Analysis (MVPA) on 20 synaesthetes and 20 control participants, we tested whether the neural processing of real colours (concentric rings) and synaesthetic colours (black graphemes) shared patterns of activations. Region of interest analyses in retinotopically and anatomically defined visual regions revealed neither evidence of shared circuits for real and synaesthetic colour processing, nor processing difference between synaesthetes and controls. We also found no correlation with individual differences, characterised by measuring the strength of synaesthetic associations. The whole brain, searchlight, analysis led to similar results. We conclude that identifying the neural correlates of the synaesthetic experience of colours may still be beyond the reach of present technology and data analysis techniques.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neurobiology of pair bonding in fishes; convergence of neural mechanisms across distant vertebrate lineages</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/214759v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Pair bonding has independently evolved numerous times among vertebrates. The governing neural mechanisms of pair bonding have only been studied in depth in the mammalian model species, the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster. In this species, oxytocin (OT), arginine vasopressin (AVP), dopamine (DA), and opioid (OP) systems play key roles in signaling in the formation and maintenance of pair bonding by targeting specific social and reward-mediating brain regions. By contrast, the neural basis of pair bonding is poorly studied in other vertebrates, and especially those of early origins, limiting our understanding of the evolutionary history of pair bonding regulatory mechanisms. We compared receptor gene expression between pair bonded and solitary individuals across eight socio-functional brain regions. We found that in females, ITR and V1aR receptor expression varied in the lateral septum-like region (the Vv/Vl), while in both sexes D1R, D2R, and MOR expression varied within the mesolimbic reward system, including a striatum-like region (the Vc); mirroring sites of action in M. ochrogaster. This study provides novel insights into the neurobiology of teleost pair bonding. It also reveals high convergence in the neurochemical mechanisms governing pair bonding across actinopterygians and sarcopterygians, by repeatedly co-opting and similarly assembling deep neurochemical and neuroanatomical homologies that originated in ancestral osteithes.</description>

	<description>The local field potential (LFP) is an aggregate measure of group neuronal activity and is often correlated with the action potentials of single neurons. In recent years investigators have found that action potential firing rates increase during elevations in power high-frequency band oscillations (50- 200 Hz range). However action potentials also contribute to the LFP signal itself, making the spike to LFP relationship complex. Here we examine the relationship between spike rates and LFPs in varying frequency bands in rat neocortical recordings. We find that 50-180 Hz oscillations correlate most consistently with high firing rates, but that other LFPs bands also carry information relating to spiking, including in some cases anti-correlations. Relatedly, we find that spiking itself and electromyographic activity contribute to LFP power in these bands. The relationship between spike rates and LFP power varies between brain states and between individual cells. Finally, we create an improved oscillation-based predictor of action potential activity by specifically utilizing information from across the entire recorded frequency spectrum of LFP. The findings illustrate both caveats and improvements to be taken into account in attempts to infer spiking activity from LFP.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Synchronous inhibitory pathways create both efficiency and diversity in the retina</title>

	<description>Visual information is conveyed from the retina to the brain by a diverse set of retinal ganglion cells. Although they have differing nonlinear properties, nearly all ganglion cell receptive fields on average compute a difference in intensity across space and time using a region known as the classical or linear surround a property that improves information transmission about natural visual scenes. The spatiotemporal visual features that create this fundamental property have not been quantitatively assigned to specific interneurons. Here we describe a generalizable causal approach using simultaneous intracellular and multielectrode recording to directly measure and manipulate the sensory feature conveyed by a neural pathway to a downstream neuron. Analyzing two inhibitory cell classes, horizontal cells and linear amacrine cells, we find that rather than transmitting different temporal features, the two inhibitory pathways act synchronously to create the salamander ganglion cell surround at different spatial scales. Using these measured visual features and theories of efficient coding, we computed a fitness landscape representing the information transmitted using different weightings of the two inhibitory pathways. This theoretical landscape revealed a ridge that maintains near-optimal information transmission while allowing for receptive field diversity. The ganglion cell population showed a striking match to this prediction, concentrating along this ridge across a wide range of positions using different weightings of amacrine or horizontal cell visual features. These results show how parallel neural pathways synthesize a sensory computation, and why this architecture achieves the potentially competing objectives of high information transmission of individual ganglion cells, and diversity among receptive fields.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: On the difficulty to interpret results when animals are singly housed: experimental epilepsy as a prototypical example</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/214528v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Many experimental approaches require housing rodents in individual cages, a stressful condition for social animals, which may act as a confounding factor for data interpretation. Comparing three groups of Wistar rats - singly housed, singly housed with daily social interaction, and animals kept in pairs - we found that socially isolated animals displayed classical markers of behavioral stress and anhedonia. We then investigated how social isolation may impact the development of epilepsy, a prototypical experimental condition requiring single housing for seizure monitoring. We found that seizures were 25 times more frequent in singly housed animals without social interaction as compared to the other two groups. Isolated animals also showed increased oxidative stress levels. Data obtained from singly housed animals without social interaction is difficult to interpret because results are obtained in a context of behavioral and oxidative stress. Preclinical studies may be strongly affected by such confounding factor.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Causal Mapping of Emotion Networks in the Human Brain: Framework and Preliminary Findings</title>

	<description>Emotions involve many cortical and subcortical regions, prominently including the amygdala. It remains unknown how these multiple network components interact, and it remains unknown how they cause the behavioral, autonomic, and experiential effects of emotions. Here we describe a framework for combining a novel technique, concurrent electrical stimulation with fMRI (es-fMRI), together with a novel analysis, inferring causal structure from fMRI data (causal discovery). We outline a research program for investigating human emotion with these new tools, and provide initial findings from two large resting-state datasets as well as case studies in neurosurgical patients with electrical stimulation of the amygdala. The overarching goal is to use causal discovery methods on fMRI data to infer causal graphical models of how brain regions interact, and then to further constrain these models with direct stimulation of specific brain regions and concurrent fMRI. We conclude by discussing limitations and future extensions. The approach could yield anatomical hypotheses about brain connectivity, motivate rational strategies for treating mood disorders with deep brain stimulation, and could be extended to animal studies that use combined optogenetic fMRI.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Abnormal reward prediction error signalling in antipsychotic naive individuals with first episode psychosis or clinical risk for psychosis</title>

	<description>Ongoing research suggests preliminary, though not entirely consistent, evidence of neural abnormalities in signalling prediction errors in schizophrenia. Supporting theories suggest mechanistic links between the disruption of these processes and the generation of psychotic symptoms. However, it is not known at what stage in psychosis these impairments in prediction error signalling develop. One major confound in prior studies is the use of medicated patients with strongly varying disease durations. Our study aims to investigate the involvement of the meso-cortico-striatal circuitry during reward prediction error signalling in the earliest stages of psychosis. We studied patients with first episode psychosis (FEP) and help-seeking individuals at risk for psychosis due to subthreshold prodromal psychotic symptoms. Patients with either FEP (n = 14), or at-risk for developing psychosis (n= 30), and healthy volunteers (n = 39) performed a reinforcement learning task during fMRI scanning. ANOVA revealed significant (p&amp;lt;0.05 family-wise error corrected) prediction error signalling differences between groups in the dopaminergic midbrain and right middle frontal gyrus (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC). Patients with FEP showed disrupted reward prediction error signalling compared to controls in both regions. At-risk patients showed intermediate activation in the midbrain that significantly differed from controls and from FEP patients, but DLPFC activation that did not differ from controls. Our study confirms that patients with FEP have abnormal meso-cortical signalling of reward prediction errors, whilst reward prediction error dysfunction in the at-risk patients appears to show a more nuanced pattern of activation with a degree of midbrain impairment but preserved cortical function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A theory of multineuronal dimensionality, dynamics and measurement</title>

	<description>In many experiments, neuroscientists tightly control behavior, record many trials, and obtain trial-averaged firing rates from hundreds of neurons in circuits containing billions of behaviorally relevant neurons. Dimensionality reduction methods reveal a striking simplicity underlying such multi-neuronal data: they can be reduced to a low-dimensional space, and the resulting neural trajectories in this space yield a remarkably insightful dynamical portrait of circuit computation. This simplicity raises profound and timely conceptual questions. What are its origins and its implications for the complexity of neural dynamics? How would the situation change if we recorded more neurons? When, if at all, can we trust dynamical portraits obtained from measuring an infinitesimal fraction of task relevant neurons? We present a theory that answers these questions, and test it using physiological recordings from reaching monkeys. This theory reveals conceptual insights into how task complexity governs both neural dimensionality and accurate recovery of dynamic portraits, thereby providing quantitative guidelines for future large-scale experimental design.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Variational Autoencoder: An Unsupervised Model for Modeling and Decoding fMRI Activity in Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/214247v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/214247v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Goal-driven convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been shown to be able to predict and decode cortical responses to natural images or videos. Here, we explored an alternative deep neural network - variational auto-encoder (VAE), as a computational model of the visual cortex. We trained a VAE with a five-layer encoder and a five-layer decoder to learn visual representations from a diverse set of unlabeled images. Inspired by the &quot;free-energy principle&quot; in neuroscience, we modeled the brain's bottom-up and top-down pathways using the VAE's encoder and decoder, respectively. Following such conceptual relationships, we found that the VAE was able to predict cortical activities observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from three human subjects watching natural videos. Compared to CNN, VAE resulted in relatively lower prediction accuracies, especially for higher-order ventral visual areas. On the other hand, fMRI responses could be decoded to estimate the VAE's latent variables, which in turn could reconstruct the visual input through the VAE's decoder. This decoding strategy was more advantageous than alternative decoding methods based on partial least square regression. This study supports the notion that the brain, at least in part, bears a generative model of the visual world.</description>

	<description>Hemispheric lateralization is a fundamental organizing principle of nervous systems across taxonomic groups with bilateral symmetry. The mammalian hippocampus is lateralized anatomically, physiologically, and chemically; however, functional asymmetries are not yet well understood. Imaging studies in humans have implicated the left and right hippocampus in specialized processing associated with episodic memory and spatial navigation, respectively. However, it is not clear if different types of input (i.e. external sensory input vs. self motion input) to the hippocampus are processed in each hemisphere. Immediate early gene (IEG) imaging in animals provides a measure of neuronal activity with a resolution at the level of single cells. To further understand functional lateralization of hippocampal processing, we compared interhemispheric expression of c-Fos in the dentate gyrus (DG), a structure involved in encoding new experiences, in mice that ran on a wheel, encoded a novel object, or remained in home cages. We found that wheel running induced the greatest amount of DG c-Fos expression in both hemispheres, with no difference in expression between the hemispheres. Object exploration resulted in left-lateralization of DG c-Fos expression, whereas control mice were not lateralized. This suggests that information regarding novel objects may be preferentially encoded by the left DG.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/214130v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>A critical function of the nervous system is the prediction of future sensory input. One such predictive computation is retinal sensitization, a form of short-term plasticity seen in multiple species that elevates local sensitivity following strong local stimulation. Here we perform a causal circuit analysis of retinal sensitization using simultaneous intracellular and multielectrode recording in the salamander. We show, using direct current injection into inhibitory sustained amacrine cells that a decrease in amacrine transmission is necessary, sufficient and occurs at the right time and manner to cause sensitization in ganglion cells. Because of neural dynamics and nonlinear pathways, a computational model is essential to explain how a change in steady inhibitory transmission causes sensitization. Whereas adaptation of excitation removes an expected result in order to transmit novelty, adaptation of inhibition provides a general mechanism to enhance the sensitivity to the sensory feature conveyed by an inhibitory pathway, creating a prediction of future input.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Percent amplitude of fluctuation: a simple measure for resting-state fMRI signal at single voxel level</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/214098v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/214098v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) measures resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) signal of each voxel. However, the unit of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal is arbitrary and hence ALFF is sensitive to the scale of raw signal. A well-accepted standardization procedure is to divide each voxel's ALFF by the global mean ALFF. However, this makes the individual voxel's ALFF dependent on the global mean. Although Fractional ALFF (fALFF), proposed as a ratio of the ALFF to the total amplitude within the full frequency band, offers possible solution of the standardization, it actually mixes with the fluctuation power within the full frequency band and thus cannot reveal the true amplitude characteristics of a given frequency band. We proposed a new standardized, stand-alone, single-voxel metrics for RS-fMRI, namely percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF). PerAF is an analog to the percent signal change that has been widely used in the task fMRI communities, which allows it to be a straightforward measurement of BOLD signal fluctuations during resting state. We further conducted a test-retest reliability analysis comparing the relevant metrics, which indicated that PerAF was generally more reliable than the ALFF and fALFF. In a real RS-fMRI application, we further demonstrated that with and without standardization by global mean PerAF yielded prominently different results when comparing eyes open with eyes closed resting conditions, suggesting that future study should provide both with and without global mean standardization. The above results suggest that PerAF is a more reliable, straightforward and promising measurement for voxelwise brain activity-based RS-fMRI studies. For prompting future application of PerAF, we also implemented this method into a user-friendly toolbox REST-PerAF.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/214056v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Motor contagions refer to implicit effects on one's actions induced by observation of other's actions. Motor contagions are believed to be induced simply by action observation and cause an observer's action to become similar to the observed action. In contrast, here we report a new motor contagion that is induced only when the observation is accompanied by prediction errors- differences between actions one observes and those he/she predicts or expects. Moreover, this contagion may not manifest as a similarity between one's own and observed actions. In our experiment, observation of the same action induced distinct motor contagions, depending on whether prediction errors are present or not. In the absence of prediction errors, similarly to previous reports, participants' actions changed to become similar to the observed action, while in the presence of prediction errors, their actions changed to diverge away from it. Our results suggest distinct effects of action observation and action prediction on human actions.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/214031v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>How are brain responses to deviant events affected by the statistics of the preceding context? We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) brain responses to frequency deviants in matched, regularly-patterned (REG) versus random (RAND) tone-pip sequences. Listeners were naive and distracted by an incidental visual task. Stimuli were very rapid so as to limit conscious reasoning about the sequence order and tap automatic processing of regularity. Deviants within REG sequences evoked a substantially larger response (by 71%) than matched deviants in RAND sequences from 80 ms after deviant onset. This effect was underpinned by distinct sources in right temporal pole and orbitofrontal cortex in addition to the standard bilateral temporal and right pre-frontal network for generic frequency deviance-detection. These findings demonstrate that the human brain rapidly acquires a detailed representation of regularities within the sensory input and evaluates incoming information according to the context established by the specific pattern.</description>

	<description>Running profoundly alters stimulus-response properties in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), but its effects in higher-order visual cortex remain unknown. Here we systematically investigated how locomotion modulates visual responses across six visual areas and three cortical layers using a massive dataset from the Allen Brain Institute. Although running has been shown to increase firing in V1, we found that it suppressed firing in higher-order visual areas. Despite this reduction in gain, visual responses during running could be decoded more accurately than visual responses during stationary periods. We show that this effect was not attributable to changes in noise correlations, and propose that it instead arises from increased reliability of single neuron responses during running.</description>

	<description>Human object-selective cortex shows a large-scale organization characterized by the high-level properties of both animacy and object-size. To what extent are these neural responses explained by primitive perceptual features that distinguish animals from objects and big objects from small objects? To address this question, we used a texture synthesis algorithm to create a novel class of stimuli -- texforms -- which preserve some mid-level texture and form information from objects while rendering them unrecognizable. We found that unrecognizable texforms were sufficient to elicit the large-scale organizations of object-selective cortex along the entire ventral pathway. Further, the structure in the neural patterns elicited by texforms was well predicted by curvature features and by intermediate layers of a deep convolutional neural network, supporting the mid-level nature of the representations. These results provide clear evidence that a substantial portion of ventral stream organization can be accounted for by coarse texture and form information, without requiring explicit recognition of intact objects.</description>

The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available ‘omics data coming from different sources, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics. Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a ‘molecular signature’) to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of ‘omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous ‘omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple ‘omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of ‘omics data available from the package.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IQCjHil1Mn0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effect of passengers' active head tilt and opening/closure of eyes on motion sickness in lateral acceleration environment of cars. (arXiv:1711.00773v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study examined the effect of passengers' active head-tilt and
eyes-open/closed conditions on the severity of motion sickness in the lateral
acceleration environment of cars. In the centrifugal head-tilt condition,
participants intentionally tilted their heads towards the centrifugal force,
whereas in the centripetal head-tilt condition, the participants tilted their
heads against the centrifugal acceleration. The eyes-open and eyes-closed cases
were investigated for each head-tilt condition. In the experimental runs, the
sickness rating in the centripetal head-tilt condition was significantly lower
than that in the centrifugal head-tilt condition. Moreover, the sickness rating
in the eyes-open condition was significantly lower than that in the eyes-closed
condition. The results suggest that an active head-tilt motion against the
centrifugal acceleration reduces the severity of motion sickness both in the
eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. They also demonstrate that the eyes-open
condition significantly reduces the motion sickness even when the head-tilt
strategy is used.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00747</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is known that car drivers tilt their head toward the center of a curve. In
addition, drivers are generally less susceptible to carsickness than are the
passengers. This paper uses a mathematical model to investigate the effect of
the head-tilt strategy on motion sickness. It is shown that tilting the head in
the centripetal direction reduces the estimated motion sickness incidence
(MSI), defined as the percentage of subjects who vomited. In addition, the head
movements of both drivers and passengers were measured in a real car. It is
also shown that the estimated MSI of the drivers is smaller than that of the
passengers. Experimental results presented in previous studies demonstrated
that the severity of motion sickness was reduced when passengers imitated the
head tilt of the driver. These results strongly suggest that the driver's head
tilt reduces motion sickness, and this can be understood as a subjective
vertical conflict.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Adaptive coordination of working-memory and reinforcement learning in non-human primates performing a trial-and-error problem solving task. (arXiv:1711.00698v1 [cs.AI])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00698</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence suggest that human behavior in trial-and-error learning
tasks based on decisions between discrete actions may involve a combination of
reinforcement learning (RL) and working-memory (WM). While the understanding of
brain activity at stake in this type of tasks often involve the comparison with
non-human primate neurophysiological results, it is not clear whether monkeys
use similar combined RL and WM processes to solve these tasks. Here we analyzed
the behavior of five monkeys with computational models combining RL and WM. Our
model-based analysis approach enables to not only fit trial-by-trial choices
but also transient slowdowns in reaction times, indicative of WM use. We found
that the behavior of the five monkeys was better explained in terms of a
combination of RL and WM despite inter-individual differences. The same
coordination dynamics we used in a previous study in humans best explained the
behavior of some monkeys while the behavior of others showed the opposite
pattern, revealing a possible different dynamics of WM process. We further
analyzed different variants of the tested models to open a discussion on how
the long pretraining in these tasks may have favored particular coordination
dynamics between RL and WM. This points towards either inter-species
differences or protocol differences which could be further tested in humans.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Sleep Stage Classification Based on Multi-level Feature Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks via Wearable Device. (arXiv:1711.00629v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00629</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00629</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a practical approach for automatic sleep stage
classification based on a multi-level feature learning framework and Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) classifier using heart rate and wrist actigraphy derived
from a wearable device. The feature learning framework is designed to extract
low- and mid-level features. Low-level features capture temporal and frequency
domain properties and mid-level features learn compositions and structural
information of signals. Since sleep staging is a sequential problem with
long-term dependencies, we take advantage of RNNs with Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) architectures for sequence data learning. To simulate
the actual situation of daily sleep, experiments are conducted with a resting
group in which sleep is recorded in resting state, and a comprehensive group in
which both resting sleep and non-resting sleep are included.We evaluate the
algorithm based on an eight-fold cross validation to classify five sleep stages
(W, N1, N2, N3, and REM). The proposed algorithm achieves weighted precision,
recall and F1 score of 58.0%, 60.3%, and 58.2% in the resting group and 58.5%,
61.1%, and 58.5% in the comprehensive group, respectively. Various comparison
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of feature learning and BLSTM. We
further explore the influence of depth and width of RNNs on performance. Our
method is specially proposed for wearable devices and is expected to be
applicable for long-term sleep monitoring at home. Without using too much prior
domain knowledge, our method has the potential to generalize sleep disorder
detection.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Derivatives and Inverse of Cascaded Linear+Nonlinear Neural Models. (arXiv:1711.00526v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00526</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00526</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In vision science, cascades of Linear+Nonlinear transforms explain a number
of perceptual experiences [Carandini&amp;amp;Heeger Nat.Rev.Neur.12]. However, the
conventional literature is usually too focused on only describing the forward
input-output transform. Instead, in this work we present the mathematical
details of such cascades beyond the forward transform, namely the derivatives
and the inverse. These analytic results (usually omitted) are important for
three reasons: (a) they are strictly necessary in new experimental methods
based on the synthesis of visual stimuli with interesting geometrical
properties, (b) they are convenient to analyze classical experiments for model
fitting, and (c) they represent a promising way to include model information in
blind visual decoding methods. Besides, statistical properties of the model are
more intuitive by using vector representations. As an example, we develop a
derivable and invertible vision model consisting of a cascade of modules that
account for brightness, contrast, energy masking, and wavelet masking. To
stress the generality of this modular setting we show examples where some of
the canonical Divisive Normalizations [Carandini&amp;amp;Heeger Nat.Rev.Neur.12] are
substituted by equivalent modules such as the Wilson-Cowan interaction
[Wilson&amp;amp;Cowan J.Biophys.72] (at the V1 cortex) or a tone-mapping [Cyriac et al.
SPIE 15] (at the retina). We illustrate the presented theory with three
applications. First, we show how the Jacobian w.r.t. the input plays a major
role in setting the model by allowing the use of novel psychophysics based on
the geometry of the neural representation (as in [Malo&amp;amp;Simoncelli SPIE 15]).
Second, we show how the Jacobian w.r.t. the parameters can be used to find the
model that better reproduces image distortion psychophysics. Third, we show
that analytic inverse may improve regression-based brain decoding techniques.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Coherent olfactory bulb gamma oscillations arise from coupling independent columnar oscillators</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/213827v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/213827v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Spike timing-based representations of sensory information depend on embedded dynamical frameworks within neural structures that establish the rules of local computation and interareal communication. Here, we investigated the dynamical properties of mouse olfactory bulb circuitry. Neurochemical activation or optogenetic stimulation of sensory afferents evoked persistent (minutes) gamma oscillations in the local field potential. These oscillations arose from slower, GABA(A) receptor-independent intracolumnar oscillators coupled by GABA(A)-ergic synapses into a faster, broadly coherent network oscillation. Consistent with the theoretical properties of coupled-oscillator networks, the spatial extent of zero-phase coherence was bounded in slices by the reduced density of lateral interactions. The intact in vivo network, however, exhibits long-range lateral interactions theoretically sufficient to enable zero-phase coherence across the complete network. These coupled-oscillator dynamics thereby establish a common clock, robust to biological heterogeneities, that is capable of supporting gamma-band phase coding across the spiking output of olfactory bulb principal neurons.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Hallucination Machine: A Deep-Dream VR platform for Studying the Phenomenology of Visual Hallucinations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/213751v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Altered states of consciousness, such as psychotic or pharmacologically-induced hallucinations, provide a unique opportunity to examine the mechanisms underlying conscious perception. However, the phenomenological properties of these states are difficult to isolate experimentally from other, more general physiological and cognitive effects of psychoactive substances or psychopathological conditions. Thus, simulating phenomenological aspects of altered states in the absence of these other more general effects provides an important experimental tool for consciousness science and psychiatry. Here we describe such a tool, the Hallucination Machine. It comprises a novel combination of two powerful technologies: deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and panoramic videos of natural scenes, viewed immersively through a head-mounted display (panoramic VR). By doing this, we are able to simulate visual hallucinatory experiences in a biologically plausible and ecologically valid way. Two experiments illustrate potential applications of the Hallucination Machine. First, we show that the system induces visual phenomenology qualitatively similar to classical psychedelics. In a second experiment, we find that simulated hallucinations do not evoke the temporal distortion commonly associated with altered states. Overall, the Hallucination Machine offers a valuable new technique for simulating altered phenomenology without directly altering the underlying neurophysiology.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prediction Error and Repetition Suppression Have Distinct Effects on Neural Representations of Visual Information</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/213710v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/213710v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Predictive coding theories argue recent experience establishes expectations in the brain that when violated generate prediction errors. Prediction errors provides a possible explanation for repetition suppression where repeated stimulus presentations yield reduced neural responses. On a predictive coding account, repetition suppression arises because the repeated stimuli are expected whereas non-repeated stimuli are unexpected, eliciting larger neural responses. Here we employed electroencephalography in human to test the predictive coding account of repetition suppression. In different blocks, streams of gratings were presented whose orientations were expected either to repeat or change. Uniquely, we applied multivariate forward modelling to determine how orientation selectivity was affected by repetition and prediction. Prediction errors were associated with significantly enhanced orientation selectivity, whereas there was no such influence on selectivity during repetition suppression. Our findings also suggest that when a prediction error is registered in the visual system, representations of expected stimulus features are transiently reactivated.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Propofol-Induced Unresponsiveness is Associated with Impaired Feedforward Connectivity in the Cortical Hierarchy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/213504v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/213504v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Impaired consciousness has been associated with impaired cortical signal propagation following transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Herein we hypothesized that the reduced current propagation under propofol-induced unresponsiveness is associated with changes in both feedforward and feedback connectivity across the cortical hierarchy. Methods: Eight subjects underwent left occipital TMS coupled with high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings during wakefulness and propofol-induced unconsciousness. Spectral analysis was applied to responses recorded from sensors overlying six hierarchical cortical sources involved in visual processing. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of evoked and induced source-space responses was used to investigate propofol effects on connectivity between regions. Results: Propofol produced a wideband reduction in evoked power following TMS in five out of six electrodes. Bayesian Model Selection supported a DCM with hierarchical feedforward and feedback connections to best fit the data. DCM of induced responses revealed that the primary effect of propofol was impaired feedforward responses in cross frequency theta/alpha-gamma coupling and within frequency theta coupling (F contrast, Family Wise Error corrected p&amp;lt;0.05). An exploratory analysis (thresholded at uncorrected p&amp;lt;0.001) also suggested that propofol impaired feedforward and feedback beta band coupling. Posthoc analyses showed impairments in all feedforward connections and one feedback connection from parietal to occipital cortex. DCM of the evoked response potential showed impaired feedforward connectivity between left sided occipital and parietal cortex (T contrast p=0.004, Bonferroni corrected). Conclusions: Our data suggest that propofol-induced loss of consciousness is associated with reduced evoked power and impaired hierarchical feedforward connectivity following occipital TMS.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A Rescorla-Wagner drift-diffusion model of conditioning and timing</title>

Computational models of classical conditioning have made significant contributions to the theoretic understanding of associative learning, yet they still struggle when the temporal aspects of conditioning are taken into account. Interval timing models have contributed a rich variety of time representations and provided accurate predictions for the timing of responses, but they usually have little to say about associative learning. In this article we present a unified model of conditioning and timing that is based on the influential Rescorla-Wagner conditioning model and the more recently developed Timing Drift-Diffusion model. We test the model by simulating 10 experimental phenomena and show that it can provide an adequate account for 8, and a partial account for the other 2. We argue that the model can account for more phenomena in the chosen set than these other similar in scope models: CSC-TD, MS-TD, Learning to Time and Modular Theory. A comparison and analysis of the mechanisms in these models is provided, with a focus on the types of time representation and associative learning rule used.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jNQVNxYySUM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25067-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test serum tau as a predictor of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25067-sec-0102&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We measured the neuronal protein tau in serum at 24, 48, and 72 hours after cardiac arrest in 689 patients in the prospective international Target Temperature Management trial. The main outcome was poor neurological outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Categories 3–5 at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25067-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased tau was associated with poor outcome at 6 months after cardiac arrest (median = 38.5, interquartile range [IQR] = 5.7–245ng/l in poor vs median = 1.5, IQR = 0.7–2.4ng/l in good outcome, for tau at 72 hours, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Tau improved prediction of poor outcome compared to using clinical information (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Tau cutoffs had low false-positive rates (FPRs) for good outcome while retaining high sensitivity for poor outcome. For example, tau at 72 hours had FPR = 2% (95% CI = 1–4%) with sensitivity = 66% (95% CI = 61–70%). Tau had higher accuracy than serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.91 for tau vs 0.86 for NSE at 72 hours, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.00024). During follow-up (up to 956 days), tau was significantly associated with overall survival. The accuracy in predicting outcome by serum tau was equally high for patients randomized to 33 °C and 36 °C targeted temperature after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Snow Queen is Evil and Beautiful: Experimental Evidence for Probabilistic Contextuality in Human Choices. (arXiv:1711.00418v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present unambiguous experimental evidence for (quantum-like) probabilistic
contextuality in psychology. All previous attempts to find contextuality in a
psychological experiment were unsuccessful because of the violations of
marginal selectivity in behavioral data (corresponding to no-signaling or
no-disturbance in quantum physics). In our crowdsourcing experiment respondents
were making two simple choices: of one of two characters in a story (The Snow
Queen by Hans Christian Andersen), and of one of two characteristics, such as
Kind or Evil, so that the character and the characteristic chosen matched the
story line. The formal structure of the experiment imitated that of the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradigm in the Bohm-Bell version. Marginal selectivity
was violated, indicating that the two choices were directly influencing each
other, but the application of a mathematical test developed in the
Contextuality-by-Default theory indicated a strong presence of contextuality
proper, not reducible to direct influences.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Functional Connectomics from Data: Probabilistic Graphical Models for Neuronal Network of C. elegans. (arXiv:1711.00193v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00193</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00193</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a data-driven approach to represent neuronal network dynamics as a
Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM). Our approach learns the PGM structure by
employing dimension reduction to network response dynamics evoked by stimuli
applied to each neuron separately. The outcome model captures how stimuli
propagate through the network and thus represents functional dependencies
between neurons, i.e., functional connectome. The benefit of using a PGM as the
functional connectome is that posterior inference can be done efficiently and
circumvent the complexities in direct inference of response pathways in dynamic
neuronal networks. In particular, posterior inference reveals the relations
between known stimuli and downstream neurons or allows to query which stimuli
are associated with downstream neurons. For validation and as an example for
our approach we apply our methodology to a model of Caenorhabiditis elegans
nervous system which structure and dynamics are well-studied. From its
dynamical model we collect time series of the network response and use singular
value decomposition to obtain a low-dimensional projection of the time series
data. We then extract dominant patterns in each data matrix to get pairwise
dependency information and create a graphical model for the full somatic
nervous system. The PGM enables us to obtain and verify underlying neuronal
pathways dominant for known behavioral scenarios and to detect possible
pathways for novel scenarios.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the serious shortcomings that characterize the current taxonomy of post-comatose disorders of consciousness (DoC), and it provides guidelines for how an improved DoC taxonomy might be developed. In particular, it is argued that behavioural criteria for the application of DoC categories should be supplemented with brain-based criteria (e.g., information derived from EEG and fMRI), and that the categorical framework that currently characterizes DoC should be replaced by a more complex framework that better captures the performance of patients across a range of cognitive and behavioural tasks.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Medial Frontal Theta Is Entrained to Rewarded Actions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rodents lick to consume fluids. The reward value of ingested fluids is likely to be encoded by neuronal activity entrained to the lick cycle. Here, we investigated relationships between licking and reward signaling by the medial frontal cortex (MFC), a key cortical region for reward-guided learning and decision-making. Multielectrode recordings of spike activity and field potentials were made in male rats as they performed an incentive contrast licking task. Rats received access to higher- and lower-value sucrose rewards over alternating 30 s periods. They learned to lick persistently when higher-value rewards were available and to suppress licking when lower-value rewards were available. Spectral analysis of spikes and fields revealed evidence for reward value being encoded by the strength of phase-locking of a 6–12 Hz theta rhythm to the rats' lick cycle. Recordings during the initial acquisition of the task found that the strength of phase-locking to the lick cycle was strengthened with experience. A modification of the task, with a temporal gap of 2 s added between reward deliveries, found that the rhythmic signals persisted during periods of dry licking, a finding that suggests the MFC encodes either the value of the currently available reward or the vigor with which rats act to consume it. Finally, we found that reversible inactivations of the MFC in the opposite hemisphere eliminated the encoding of reward information. Together, our findings establish that a 6–12 Hz theta rhythm, generated by the rodent MFC, is synchronized to rewarded actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The cellular and behavioral mechanisms of reward signaling by the medial frontal cortex (MFC) have not been resolved. We report evidence for a 6–12 Hz theta rhythm that is generated by the MFC and synchronized with ongoing consummatory actions. Previous studies of MFC reward signaling have inferred value coding upon temporally sustained activity during the period of reward consumption. Our findings suggest that MFC activity is temporally sustained due to the consumption of the rewarding fluids, and not necessarily the abstract properties of the rewarding fluid. Two other major findings were that the MFC reward signals persist beyond the period of fluid delivery and are generated by neurons within the MFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: AQP4e-Based Orthogonal Arrays Regulate Rapid Cell Volume Changes in Astrocytes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/44/10748?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4) plays a key role in the regulation of water homeostasis in the brain. It is predominantly expressed in astrocytes at the blood–brain and blood–liquor interfaces. Although several AQP4 isoforms have been identified in the mammalian brain, two, AQP4a (M1) and AQP4c (M23), have been confirmed to cluster into plasma membrane supramolecular structures, termed orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs) and to enhance water transport through the plasma membrane. However, the role of the newly described water-conductive mammalian isoform AQP4e is unknown. Here, the dynamics of AQP4e aggregation into OAPs and its role in the regulation of astrocyte water homeostasis have been studied. Using super-resolution structured illumination, atomic force, and confocal microscopies, the results revealed that, in female rat astrocytes, AQP4e isoform colocalizes with OAPs, affecting its structural dynamics. In hypoosmotic conditions, which elicit cell edema, OAP formation was considerably enhanced by overexpressed AQP4e. Moreover, the kinetics of the cell swelling and of the regulatory volume decrease was faster in astrocytes overexpressing AQP4e compared with untransfected controls. Furthermore, the increase in maximal cell volume elicited by hypoosmotic stimulation was significantly smaller in AQP4e-overexpressing astrocytes. For the first time, this study demonstrates an active role of AQP4e in the regulation of OAP structural dynamics and in water homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4) plays a key role in the regulation of water homeostasis in the brain. To date, only AQP4a and AQP4c isoforms have been confirmed to enhance water transport through plasmalemma and to cluster into orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs). We here studied the dynamics, aggregation, and role in the regulation of astrocyte water homeostasis of the newly described water-conductive mammalian isoform AQP4e. Our main findings are as follows: brain edema mimicking hypoosmotic conditions stimulates the formation of new OAPs with larger diameters, due to the incorporation of additional cytoplasmic AQP4 channels and the redistribution of AQP4 channels of the existing OAPs; and AQP4e affects the dynamics of cell swelling and regulatory volume decrease in astrocytes exposed to hypoosmotic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: SK Channels Regulate Resting Properties and Signaling Reliability of a Developing Fast-Spiking Neuron</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/44/10738?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/44/10738?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reliable and precise signal transmission is essential in circuits of the auditory brainstem to encode timing with submillisecond accuracy. Globular bushy cells reliably and faithfully transfer spike signals to the principal neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) through the giant glutamatergic synapse, the calyx of Held. Thus, the MNTB works as a relay nucleus that preserves the temporal pattern of firing at high frequency. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we observed a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance mediated by small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels in the MNTB neurons from rats of either sex. SK channels were activated by intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sparks and mediated spontaneous transient outward currents in developing MNTB neurons. SK channels were also activated by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and synaptically activated NMDA receptors. Blocking SK channels with apamin depolarized the resting membrane potential, reduced resting conductance, and affected the responsiveness of MNTB neurons to signal inputs. Moreover, SK channels were activated by action potentials and affected the spike afterhyperpolarization. Blocking SK channels disrupted the one-to-one signal transmission from presynaptic calyces to postsynaptic MNTB neurons and induced extra postsynaptic action potentials in response to presynaptic firing. These data reveal that SK channels play crucial roles in regulating the resting properties and maintaining reliable signal transmission of MNTB neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Reliable and precise signal transmission is required in auditory brainstem circuits to localize the sound source. The calyx of Held synapse in the mammalian medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) plays an important role in sound localization. We investigated the potassium channels that shape the reliability of signal transfer across the calyceal synapse and observed a potassium conductance mediated by small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels in rat MNTB principal neurons. We found that SK channels are tonically activated and contribute to the resting membrane properties of MNTB neurons. Interestingly, SK channels are transiently activated by calcium sparks and calcium influx during action potentials and control the one-to-one signal transmission from presynaptic calyces to postsynaptic MNTB neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In situations in which impending sensory events demand fast action choices, we must be ready to prioritize higher-value courses of action to avoid missed opportunities. When such a situation first presents itself, stimulus–action contingencies and their relative value must be encoded to establish a value-biased state of preparation for an impending sensorimotor decision. Here, we sought to identify neurophysiological signatures of such processes in the human brain (both female and male). We devised a task requiring fast action choices based on the discrimination of a simple visual cue in which the differently valued sensory alternatives were presented 750–800 ms before as peripheral &quot;targets&quot; that specified the stimulus–action mapping for the upcoming decision. In response to the targets, we identified a discrete, transient, spatially selective signal in the event-related potential (ERP), which scaled with relative value and strongly predicted the degree of behavioral bias in the upcoming decision both across and within subjects. This signal is not compatible with any hitherto known ERP signature of spatial selection and also bears novel distinctions with respect to characterizations of value-sensitive, spatially selective activity found in sensorimotor areas of nonhuman primates. Specifically, a series of follow-up experiments revealed that the signal was reliably invoked regardless of response laterality, response modality, sensory feature, and reward valence. It was absent, however, when the response deadline was relaxed and the strategic need for biasing removed. Therefore, more than passively representing value or salience, the signal appears to play a versatile and active role in adaptive sensorimotor prioritization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In many situations such as fast-moving sports, we must be ready to act fast in response to sensory events and, in our preparation, prioritize courses of action that lead to greater rewards. Although behavioral effects of value biases in sensorimotor decision making have been widely studied, little is known about the neural processes that set these biases in place beforehand. Here, we report the discovery of a transient, spatially selective neural signal in humans that encodes the relative value of competing decision alternatives and strongly predicts behavioral value biases in decisions made ~500 ms later. Follow-up manipulations of value differential, reward valence, response modality, sensory features, and time constraints establish that the signal reflects an active, feature- and effector-general preparatory mechanism for value-based prioritization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Unaware Processing of Tools in the Neural System for Object-Directed Action Representation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis that the brain constitutively encodes observed manipulable objects for the actions they afford is still debated. Yet, crucial evidence demonstrating that, even in the absence of perceptual awareness, the mere visual appearance of a manipulable object triggers a visuomotor coding in the action representation system including the premotor cortex, has hitherto not been provided. In this fMRI study, we instantiated reliable unaware visual perception conditions by means of continuous flash suppression, and we tested in 24 healthy human participants (13 females) whether the visuomotor object-directed action representation system that includes left-hemispheric premotor, parietal, and posterior temporal cortices is activated even under subliminal perceptual conditions. We found consistent activation in the target visuomotor cortices, both with and without perceptual awareness, specifically for pictures of manipulable versus non-manipulable objects. By means of a multivariate searchlight analysis, we also found that the brain activation patterns in this visuomotor network enabled the decoding of manipulable versus non-manipulable object picture processing, both with and without awareness. These findings demonstrate the intimate neural coupling between visual perception and motor representation that underlies manipulable object processing: manipulable object stimuli specifically engage the visuomotor object-directed action representation system, in a constitutive manner that is independent from perceptual awareness. This perceptuo-motor coupling endows the brain with an efficient mechanism for monitoring and planning reactions to external stimuli in the absence of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our brain constantly encodes the visual information that hits the retina, leading to a stimulus-specific activation of sensory and semantic representations, even for objects that we do not consciously perceive. Do these unconscious representations encompass the motor programming of actions that could be accomplished congruently with the objects' functions? In this fMRI study, we instantiated unaware visual perception conditions, by dynamically suppressing the visibility of manipulable object pictures with mondrian masks. Despite escaping conscious perception, manipulable objects activated an object-directed action representation system that includes left-hemispheric premotor, parietal, and posterior temporal cortices. This demonstrates that visuomotor encoding occurs independently of conscious object perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activity Patterns Elicited by Airflow in the Olfactory Bulb and Their Possible Functions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/44/10700?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) can sense both odorants and airflows. In the olfactory bulb (OB), the coding of odor information has been well studied, but the coding of mechanical stimulation is rarely investigated. Unlike odor-sensing functions of OSNs, the airflow-sensing functions of OSNs are also largely unknown. Here, the activity patterns elicited by mechanical airflow in male rat OBs were mapped using fMRI and correlated with local field potential recordings. In an attempt to reveal possible functions of airflow sensing, the relationship between airflow patterns and physiological parameters was also examined. We found the following: (1) the activity pattern in the OB evoked by airflow in the nasal cavity was more broadly distributed than patterns evoked by odors; (2) the pattern intensity increases with total airflow, while the pattern topography with total airflow remains almost unchanged; and (3) the heart rate, spontaneous respiratory rate, and electroencephalograph power in the β band decreased with regular mechanical airflow in the nasal cavity. The mapping results provide evidence that the signals elicited by mechanical airflow in OSNs are transmitted to the OB, and that the OB has the potential to code and process mechanical information. Our functional data indicate that airflow rhythm in the olfactory system can regulate the physiological and brain states, providing an explanation for the effects of breath control in meditation, yoga, and Taoism practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Presentation of odor information in the olfactory bulb has been well studied, but studies about breathing features are rare. Here, using blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI for the first time in such an investigation, we explored the global activity patterns in the rat olfactory bulb elicited by airflow in the nasal cavity. We found that the activity pattern elicited by airflow is broadly distributed, with increasing pattern intensity and similar topography under increasing total airflow. Further, heart rate, spontaneous respiratory rate in the lung, and electroencephalograph power in the β band decreased with regular airflow in the nasal cavity. Our study provides further understanding of the airflow map in the olfactory bulb &lt;i&gt;in viv&lt;/i&gt;o, and evidence for the possible mechanosensitivity functions of olfactory sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: CaMKII Regulates Synaptic NMDA Receptor Activity of Hypothalamic Presympathetic Neurons and Sympathetic Outflow in Hypertension</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;NMDAR activity in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is increased and critically involved in heightened sympathetic vasomotor tone in hypertension. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) binds to and modulates NMDAR activity. In this study, we determined the role of CaMKII in regulating NMDAR activity of PVN presympathetic neurons in male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). NMDAR-mediated EPSCs and puff NMDA-elicited currents were recorded in spinally projecting PVN neurons in SHRs and male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The basal amplitude of evoked NMDAR-EPSCs and puff NMDA currents in retrogradely labeled PVN neurons were significantly higher in SHRs than in WKY rats. The CaMKII inhibitor autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide (AIP) normalized the increased amplitude of NMDAR-EPSCs and puff NMDA currents in labeled PVN neurons in SHRs but had no effect in WKY rats. Treatment with AIP also normalized the higher frequency of NMDAR-mediated miniature EPSCs of PVN neurons in SHRs. CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation level of GluN2B serine 1303 (S1303) in the PVN, but not in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, was significantly higher in SHRs than in WKY rats. Lowering blood pressure with celiac ganglionectomy in SHRs did not alter the increased level of phosphorylated GluN2B S1303 in the PVN. In addition, microinjection of AIP into the PVN significantly reduced arterial blood pressure and lumbar sympathetic nerve discharges in SHRs. Our findings suggest that CaMKII activity is increased in the PVN and contributes to potentiated presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity to elevate sympathetic vasomotor tone in hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Heightened sympathetic vasomotor tone is a major contributor to the development of hypertension. Although glutamate NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitatory drive in the hypothalamus plays a critical role in increased sympathetic output in hypertension, the molecular mechanism involved in potentiated NMDAR activity of hypothalamic presympathetic neurons remains unclear. Here we show that the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is increased and plays a key role in the potentiated presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity of hypothalamic presympathetic neurons in hypertension. Also, the inhibition of CaMKII in the hypothalamus reduces elevated blood pressure and sympathetic nerve discharges in hypertension. This new knowledge extends our understanding of the mechanism of synaptic plasticity in the hypothalamus and suggests new strategies to treat neurogenic hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Submillisecond Optogenetic Control of Neuronal Firing with Two-Photon Holographic Photoactivation of Chronos</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/44/10679?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/44/10679?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic neuronal network manipulation promises to unravel a long-standing mystery in neuroscience: how does microcircuit activity relate causally to behavioral and pathological states? The challenge to evoke spikes with high spatial and temporal complexity necessitates further joint development of light-delivery approaches and custom opsins. Two-photon (2P) light-targeting strategies demonstrated in-depth generation of action potentials in photosensitive neurons both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, but thus far lack the temporal precision necessary to induce precisely timed spiking events. Here, we show that efficient current integration enabled by 2P holographic amplified laser illumination of Chronos, a highly light-sensitive and fast opsin, can evoke spikes with submillisecond precision and repeated firing up to 100 Hz in brain slices from Swiss male mice. These results pave the way for optogenetic manipulation with the spatial and temporal sophistication necessary to mimic natural microcircuit activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To reveal causal links between neuronal activity and behavior, it is necessary to develop experimental strategies to induce spatially and temporally sophisticated perturbation of network microcircuits. Two-photon computer generated holography (2P-CGH) recently demonstrated 3D optogenetic control of selected pools of neurons with single-cell accuracy in depth in the brain. Here, we show that exciting the fast opsin Chronos with amplified laser 2P-CGH enables cellular-resolution targeting with unprecedented temporal control, driving spiking up to 100 Hz with submillisecond onset precision using low laser power densities. This system achieves a unique combination of spatial flexibility and temporal precision needed to pattern optogenetically inputs that mimic natural neuronal network activity patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional Characterization of 5-HT1B Receptor Drugs in Nonhuman Primates Using Simultaneous PET-MR</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/44/10671?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/44/10671?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we used a simultaneous PET-MR experimental design to investigate the effects of functionally different compounds (agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist) on 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt;R) occupancy and the associated hemodynamic responses. In anesthetized male nonhuman primates (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3), we used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the radioligand [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]AZ10419369 administered as a bolus followed by constant infusion to measure changes in 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt;R occupancy. Simultaneously, we measured changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) as a proxy of drug effects on neuronal activity. The 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt;R partial agonist AZ10419369 elicited a dose-dependent biphasic hemodynamic response that was related to the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt;R occupancy. The magnitude of the response was spatially overlapping with high cerebral 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt;R densities. High doses of AZ10419369 exerted an extracranial tissue vasoconstriction that was comparable to the less blood–brain barrier-permeable 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt;R agonist sumatriptan. By contrast, injection of the antagonist GR127935 did not elicit significant hemodynamic responses, even at a 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt;R cerebral occupancy similar to the one obtained with a high dose of AZ10419369. Given the knowledge we have of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt;R and its function and distribution in the brain, the hemodynamic response informs us about the functionality of the given drug: changes in CBV are only produced when the receptor is stimulated by the partial agonist AZ10419369 and not by the antagonist GR127935, consistent with low basal occupancy by endogenous serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We here show that combined simultaneous positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging uniquely enables the assessment of CNS active compounds. We conducted a series of pharmacological interventions to interrogate 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor binding and function and determined blood–brain barrier passage of drugs and demonstrate target involvement. Importantly, we show how the spatial and temporal effects on brain hemodynamics provide information about pharmacologically driven downstream CNS drug effects; the brain hemodynamic response shows characteristic dose-related effects that differ depending on agonistic or antagonistic drug characteristics and on local 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor density. The technique lends itself to a comprehensive &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; investigation and understanding of drugs' effects in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Prediction of Impact of a Looming Stimulus onto the Body Is Subserved by Multisensory Integration Mechanisms</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the jungle, survival is highly correlated with the ability to detect and distinguish between an approaching predator and a putative prey. From an ecological perspective, a predator rapidly approaching its prey is a stronger cue for flight than a slowly moving predator. In the present study, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging in the nonhuman primate, to investigate the neural bases of the prediction of an impact to the body by a looming stimulus, i.e., the neural bases of the interaction between a dynamic visual stimulus approaching the body and its expected consequences onto an independent sensory modality, namely, touch. We identify a core cortical network of occipital, parietal, premotor, and prefrontal areas maximally activated by tactile stimulations presented at the predicted time and location of impact of the looming stimulus on the faces compared with the activations observed for spatially or temporally incongruent tactile and dynamic visual cues. These activations reflect both an active integration of visual and tactile information and of spatial and temporal prediction information. The identified cortical network coincides with a well described multisensory visuotactile convergence and integration network suggested to play a key role in the definition of peripersonal space. These observations are discussed in the context of multisensory integration and spatial, temporal prediction and Bayesian causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Looming stimuli have a particular ecological relevance as they are expected to come into contact with the body, evoking touch or pain sensations and possibly triggering an approach or escape behavior depending on their identity. Here, we identify the nonhuman primate functional network that is maximally activated by tactile stimulations presented at the predicted time and location of impact of the looming stimulus. Our findings suggest that the integration of spatial and temporal predictive cues possibly rely on the same neural mechanisms that are involved in multisensory integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Crucial Test of the Population Separation Model of Auditory Stream Segregation in Macaque Primary Auditory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/44/10645?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of auditory scene analysis is auditory stream segregation—the organization of sound sequences into perceptual streams reflecting different sound sources in the environment. Several models have been proposed to account for stream segregation. According to the &quot;population separation&quot; (PS) model, alternating ABAB tone sequences are perceived as a single stream or as two separate streams when &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; tones activate the same or distinct frequency-tuned neuronal populations in primary auditory cortex (A1), respectively. A crucial test of the PS model is whether it can account for the observation that A and B tones are generally perceived as a single stream when presented synchronously, rather than in an alternating pattern, even if they are widely separated in frequency. Here, we tested the PS model by recording neural responses to alternating (ALT) and synchronous (SYNC) tone sequences in A1 of male macaques. Consistent with predictions of the PS model, a greater effective tonotopic separation of A and B tone responses was observed under ALT than under SYNC conditions, thus paralleling the perceptual organization of the sequences. While other models of stream segregation, such as temporal coherence, are not excluded by the present findings, we conclude that PS is sufficient to account for the perceptual organization of ALT and SYNC sequences and thus remains a viable model of auditory stream segregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; According to the population separation (PS) model of auditory stream segregation, sounds that activate the same or separate neural populations in primary auditory cortex (A1) are perceived as one or two streams, respectively. It is unclear, however, whether the PS model can account for the perception of sounds as a single stream when they are presented synchronously. Here, we tested the PS model by recording neural responses to alternating (ALT) and synchronous (SYNC) tone sequences in macaque A1. A greater effective separation of tonotopic activity patterns was observed under ALT than under SYNC conditions, thus paralleling the perceptual organization of the sequences. Based on these findings, we conclude that PS remains a plausible neurophysiological model of auditory stream segregation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Role of Oscillatory Phase in Determining the Temporal Organization of Perception: Evidence from Sensory Entrainment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/44/10636?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/44/10636?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent behavioral, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological studies have renewed the idea that the information processing within different temporal windows is linked to the phase and/or frequency of the ongoing oscillations, predominantly in the theta/alpha band (~4–7 and 8–12 Hz, respectively). However, being correlational in nature, this evidence might reflect a nonfunctional byproduct rather than having a causal role. A more direct link can be shown with methods that manipulate oscillatory activity. Here, we used audiovisual entrainment at different frequencies in the prestimulus period of a temporal integration/segregation task. We hypothesized that entrainment would align ongoing oscillations and drive them toward the stimulation frequency. To reveal behavioral oscillations in temporal perception after the entrainment, we sampled the segregation/integration performance densely in time. In Experiment 1, two groups of human participants (both males and females) received stimulation either at the lower or the upper boundary of the alpha band (~8.5 vs 11.5 Hz). For both entrainment frequencies, we found a phase alignment of the perceptual oscillation across subjects, but with two different power spectra that peaked near the entrainment frequency. These results were confirmed when perceptual oscillations were characterized in the time domain with sinusoidal fittings. In Experiment 2, we replicated the findings in a within-subject design, extending the results for frequencies in the theta (~6.5 Hz), but not in the beta (~15 Hz), range. Overall, these findings show that temporal segregation can be modified by sensory entrainment, providing evidence for a critical role of ongoing oscillations in the temporal organization of perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The continuous flow of sensory input is not processed in an analog fashion, but rather is grouped by the perceptual system over time. Recent studies pinpointed the phase and/or frequency of the neural oscillations in the theta/alpha band (~4–12 Hz) as possible mechanisms underlying temporal windows in perception. Here, we combined two innovative methodologies to provide more direct support for this evidence. We used sensory entrainment to align neural oscillations to different frequencies and then characterized the resultant perceptual oscillation with a temporal dense sampling of the integration/segregation performance. Our results provide the first evidence that the frequency of temporal segregation can be modified by sensory entrainment, supporting a critical role of ongoing oscillations in the integration/segregation of information over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Interneurons in the Honeybee Primary Auditory Center Responding to Waggle Dance-Like Vibration Pulses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/44/10624?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Female honeybees use the &quot;waggle dance&quot; to communicate the location of nectar sources to their hive mates. Distance information is encoded in the duration of the waggle phase (von Frisch, 1967). During the waggle phase, the dancer produces trains of vibration pulses, which are detected by the follower bees via Johnston's organ located on the antennae. To uncover the neural mechanisms underlying the encoding of distance information in the waggle dance follower, we investigated morphology, physiology, and immunohistochemistry of interneurons arborizing in the primary auditory center of the honeybee (&lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;). We identified major interneuron types, named DL-Int-1, DL-Int-2, and bilateral DL-dSEG-LP, that responded with different spiking patterns to vibration pulses applied to the antennae. Experimental and computational analyses suggest that inhibitory connection plays a role in encoding and processing the duration of vibration pulse trains in the primary auditory center of the honeybee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The waggle dance represents a form of symbolic communication used by honeybees to convey the location of food sources via species-specific sound. The brain mechanisms used to decipher this symbolic information are unknown. We examined interneurons in the honeybee primary auditory center and identified different neuron types with specific properties. The results of our computational analyses suggest that inhibitory connection plays a role in encoding waggle dance signals. Our results are critical for understanding how the honeybee deciphers information from the sound produced by the waggle dance and provide new insights regarding how common neural mechanisms are used by different species to achieve communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Zic-Proteins Are Repressors of Dopaminergic Forebrain Fate in Mice and C. elegans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the postnatal forebrain regionalized neural stem cells along the ventricular walls produce olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons with varying neurotransmitter phenotypes and positions. To understand the molecular basis of this region-specific variability we analyzed gene expression in the postnatal dorsal and lateral lineages in mice of both sexes from stem cells to neurons. We show that both lineages maintain transcription factor signatures of their embryonic site of origin, the pallium and subpallium. However, additional factors, including Zic1 and Zic2, are postnatally expressed in the dorsal stem cell compartment and maintained in the lineage that generates calretinin-positive GABAergic neurons for the OB. Functionally, we show that Zic1 and Zic2 induce the generation of calretinin-positive neurons while suppressing dopaminergic fate in the postnatal dorsal lineage. We investigated the evolutionary conservation of the dopaminergic repressor function of Zic proteins and show that it is already present in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The vertebrate brain generates thousands of different neuron types. In this work we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this variability. Using a genomics approach we identify the transcription factor signatures of defined neural stem cells and neuron populations. Based thereon we show that two related transcription factors, Zic1 and Zic2, are essential to control the balance between two defined neuron types in the postnatal brain. We show that this mechanism is conserved in evolutionary very distant species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The proper function of synapses relies on efficient recycling of synaptic vesicles. The small size of synaptic boutons has hampered efforts to define the dynamical states of vesicles during recycling. Moreover, whether vesicle motion during recycling is regulated by neural activity remains largely unknown. We combined nanoscale-resolution tracking of individual synaptic vesicles in cultured hippocampal neurons from rats of both sexes with advanced motion analyses to demonstrate that the majority of recently endocytosed vesicles undergo sequences of transient dynamical states including epochs of directed, diffusional, and stalled motion. We observed that vesicle motion is modulated in an activity-dependent manner, with dynamical changes apparent in ~20% of observed boutons. Within this subpopulation of boutons, 35% of observed vesicles exhibited acceleration and 65% exhibited deceleration, accompanied by corresponding changes in directed motion. Individual vesicles observed in the remaining ~80% of boutons did not exhibit apparent dynamical changes in response to stimulation. More quantitative transient motion analyses revealed that the overall reduction of vesicle mobility, and specifically of the directed motion component, is the predominant activity-evoked change across the entire bouton population. Activity-dependent modulation of vesicle mobility may represent an important mechanism controlling vesicle availability and neurotransmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mechanisms governing synaptic vesicle dynamics during recycling remain poorly understood. Using nanoscale resolution tracking of individual synaptic vesicles in hippocampal synapses and advanced motion analysis tools we demonstrate that synaptic vesicles undergo complex sets of dynamical states that include epochs of directed, diffusive, and stalled motion. Most importantly, our analyses revealed that vesicle motion is modulated in an activity-dependent manner apparent as the reduction in overall vesicle mobility in response to stimulation. These results define the vesicle dynamical states during recycling and reveal their activity-dependent modulation. Our study thus provides fundamental new insights into the principles governing synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Fremanezumab--A Humanized Monoclonal Anti-CGRP Antibody--Inhibits Thinly Myelinated (A{delta}) But Not Unmyelinated (C) Meningeal Nociceptors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), the most abundant neuropeptide in primary afferent sensory neurons, is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine headache, but its role in migraine is still equivocal. As a new approach to migraine treatment, humanized anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) were developed to reduce the availability of CGRP, and were found effective in reducing the frequency of chronic and episodic migraine. We recently tested the effect of fremanezumab (TEV-48125), a CGRP-mAb, on the activity of second-order trigeminovascular dorsal horn neurons that receive peripheral input from the cranial dura, and found a selective inhibition of high-threshold but not wide-dynamic range class of neurons. To investigate the basis for this selective inhibitory effect, and further explore the mechanism of action of CGRP-mAbs, we tested the effect of fremanezumab on the cortical spreading depression-evoked activation of mechanosensitive primary afferent meningeal nociceptors that innervate the cranial dura, using single-unit recording in the trigeminal ganglion of anesthetized male rats. Fremanezumab pretreatment selectively inhibited the responsiveness of A neurons, but not C-fiber neurons, as reflected in a decrease in the percentage of neurons that showed activation by cortical spreading depression. These findings identify A meningeal nociceptors as a likely site of action of fremanezumab in the prevention of headache. The selectivity in its peripheral inhibitory action may partly account for fremanezumab's selective inhibition of high-threshold, as a result of a predominant A- input to high-threshold neurons, but not wide dynamic-range dorsal horn neurons, and why it may not be effective in all migraine patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recently, we reported that humanized CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) prevent activation and sensitization of high-threshold (HT) but not wide-dynamic range trigeminovascular neurons by cortical spreading depression (CSD). In the current paper, we report that CGRP-mAbs prevent the activation of A but not C-type meningeal nociceptors by CSD. This is the first identification of an anti-migraine drug that appears to be selective for A-fibers (peripherally) and HT neurons (centrally). As the main CGRP-mAb site of action appears to be situated outside the brain, we conclude that the initiation of the headache phase of migraine depends on activation of meningeal nociceptors, and that for selected patients, activation of the A-HT pain pathway may be sufficient for the generation of headache perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested the hypothesis that somatosensory system injury would more strongly affect movement than motor system injury in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (USCP). This hypothesis was based on how somatosensory and corticospinal circuits adapt to injury during development; whereas the motor system can maintain connections to the impaired hand from the uninjured hemisphere, this does not occur in the somatosensory system. As a corollary, cortical injury strongly impairs sensory function, so we hypothesized that cortical lesions would impair hand function more than subcortical lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four children with unilateral cerebral palsy had physiological and anatomical measures of the motor and somatosensory systems and lesion classification. Motor physiology was performed with transcranial magnetic stimulation and somatosensory physiology with vibration-evoked electroencephalographic potentials. Tractography of the corticospinal tract and the medial lemniscus was performed with diffusion tensor imaging, and lesions were classified by magnetic resonance imaging. Anatomical and physiological results were correlated with measures of hand function using 2 independent statistical methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with disruptions in the somatosensory connectivity and cortical lesions had the most severe upper extremity impairments, particularly somatosensory function. Motor system connectivity was significantly correlated with bimanual function, but not unimanual function or somatosensory function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25080-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sensory and motor connectivity impact hand function in children with USCP. Somatosensory connectivity could be an important target for recovery of hand function in children with USCP. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) is limited in its temporal length and capacity. Classic
conceptions of WM capacity assume the system possesses a finite number of
slots, but recent evidence suggests WM may be a continuous resource. Resource
models typically assume there is no hard upper bound on the number of items
that can be stored, but WM fidelity decreases with the number of items. We
analyze a neural field model of multi-item WM that associates each item with
the location of a bump in a finite spatial domain, considering items that span
a one-dimensional continuous feature space. Our analysis relates the neural
architecture of the network to accumulated errors and capacity limitations
arising during the delay period of a multi-item WM task. Networks with stronger
synapses support wider bumps that interact more, whereas networks with weaker
synapses support narrower bumps that are more susceptible to noise
perturbations. There is an optimal synaptic strength that both limits bump
interaction events and the effects of noise perturbations. This optimum shifts
to weaker synapses as the number of items stored in the network is increased.
Our model not only provides a neural circuit explanation for WM capacity, but
also speaks to how capacity relates to the arrangement of stored items in a
feature space.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper predicts the ability to externally control the firing times of a
cortical neuron whose behavior follows the Izhikevich neuron model. The
Izhikevich model provides an efficient and biologically plausible method to
track a cortical neuron's membrane potential and its firing times. The external
control is a simple optogenetic model represented by a constant current source
that can be turned on or off. This paper considers a firing frequency that is
sufficiently low for the membrane potential to return to its resting potential
after it fires. The time required for the neuron to charge and for the neuron
to recover to the resting potential are fitted to functions of the Izhikevich
model parameters. Results show that linear functions of the model parameters
can predict the charging times with some accuracy and are sufficient to
estimate the highest firing frequency achievable without interspike
interference.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive neuroscience is enjoying rapid increase in extensive public
brain-imaging datasets. It opens the door to large-scale statistical models.
Finding a unified perspective for all available data calls for scalable and
automated solutions to an old challenge: how to aggregate heterogeneous
information on brain function into a universal cognitive system that relates
mental operations/cognitive processes/psychological tasks to brain networks? We
cast this challenge in a machine-learning approach to predict conditions from
statistical brain maps across different studies. For this, we leverage
multi-task learning and multi-scale dimension reduction to learn
low-dimensional representations of brain images that carry cognitive
information and can be robustly associated with psychological stimuli. Our
multi-dataset classification model achieves the best prediction performance on
several large reference datasets, compared to models without cognitive-aware
low-dimension representations; it brings a substantial performance boost to the
analysis of small datasets, and can be introspected to identify universal
template cognitive concepts.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Today the human brain can be modeled as a graph where nodes represent
different regions and links stand for statistical interactions between their
activities as recorded by different neuroimaging techniques. Empirical studies
have lead to the hypothesis that brain functions rely on the coordination of a
scattered mosaic of functionally specialized brain regions (modules or
sub-networks), forming a web-like structure of coordinated assemblies (a
network of networks). The study of brain dynamics would therefore benefit from
an inspection of how functional sub-networks interact between them. In this
paper, we model the brain as an interconnected system composed of two specific
sub-networks, the left (L) and right (R) hemispheres, which compete with each
other for centrality, a topological measure of importance in a networked
system. Specifically, we consideredfunctional brain networks derived from
high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and investigated how node
centrality is shaped by interhemispheric connections. Our results show that the
distribution of centrality strongly depends on the number of functional
connections between hemispheres and the way these connections are distributed.
Additionally, we investigated the consequences of node failure on hemispherical
centrality, and showed how the abundance of inter-hemispheric links favors the
functional balance of centrality distribution between the hemispheres.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We develop of a line of work initiated by Curto and Itskov towards
understanding the amount of information contained in the spike trains of
hippocampal place cells via topology considerations. Previously, it was
established that simply knowing which groups of place cells fire together in an
animal's hippocampus is sufficient to extract the global topology of the
animal's physical environment. We model a system where collections of place
cells group and ungroup according to short-term plasticity rules. In
particular, we obtain the surprising result that in experiments with spurious
firing, the accuracy of the extracted topological information decreases with
the persistence (beyond a certain regime) of the cell groups. This suggests
that synaptic transience, or forgetting, is a mechanism by which the brain
counteracts the effects of spurious place cell activity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: High-dimensional brain. A tool for encoding and rapid learning of memories by single neurons. (arXiv:1710.11227v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11227</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11227</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Codifying memories is one of the fundamental problems of modern Neuroscience.
The functional mechanisms behind remain largely unknown. An experimental
evidence suggests that some of the memory functions are performed by stratified
brain structures as, e.g., the hippocampus. In this particular case, single
neurons in the CA1 region receive a highly multidimensional input from the CA3
area, which is a hub for information processing. We thus assess the implication
of the abundance of neuronal signaling routs converging onto single cells on
the information processing. We show that single neurons can selectively detect
and learn arbitrary information items, given that they operate in high
dimensions. The argument is based on Stochastic Separation Theorems and measure
concentration phenomena. We demonstrate that a simple enough functional
neuronal model is capable of explaining: i) the extreme selectivity of single
neurons to the information content, ii) simultaneous separation of several
uncorrelated stimuli, or informational items, from a large set, and iii)
dynamic learning of new items by associating them with already &quot;known&quot; ones.
These results constitute a basis for organization of complex memories in
ensembles of single neurons. Moreover, they show that no a priori assumptions
on the structural organization of neuronal ensembles are necessary for
explaining basic concepts of static and dynamic memories.

	<description>The striking diversity of cells in the nervous system has long inspired scientists to ask how the various cell types of the nervous system are generated, wired, and respond to each other to allow for the diverse and dynamic behaviors generated by the brain. Neuronal cell biology has been a cornerstone of Neuron since its inception in 1988 and was the focus of a previous special issue in 2003. Just as systems and cognitive neuroscience is flourishing with new technologies to manipulate and visualize neural circuits, molecular and cellular neuroscience is in a time of growth and rapid discovery.</description>

	<description>During malaria blood-stage infections, Plasmodium parasites interact with the RBC surface to enable invasion followed by intracellular proliferation. Critical factors involved in invasion have been identified using biochemical and genetic approaches including specific knockdowns of genes of interest from primary CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (cRBCs). Here we report the development...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/KHrPEvPlCLY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Breast cancer (BC) remains the primary cause of death from cancer among women worldwide. Cholesterol-5,6-epoxide (5,6-EC) metabolism is deregulated in BC but the molecular origin of this is unknown. Here, we have identified an oncometabolism downstream of 5,6-EC that promotes BC progression independently of estrogen receptor α expression. We show...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/JOF4BJt1h8E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>T cell signaling initiates upon the binding of peptide-loaded MHC (pMHC) on an antigen-presenting cell to the T cell receptor (TCR) on a T cell. TCR phosphorylation in response to pMHC binding is accompanied by segregation of the transmembrane phosphatase CD45 away from TCR–pMHC complexes. The kinetic segregation hypothesis proposes...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/fi9EIN7IoJA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease targeting the central nervous system (CNS) mainly in young adults, and a breakage of immune tolerance to CNS self-antigens has been suggested to initiate CNS autoimmunity.

	<description>The family of WD40-repeat (WDR) proteins is one of the largest in eukaryotes, but little is known about their function in brain development. Among 26 WDR genes assessed, we found 7 displaying a major impact in neuronal morphology when inactivated in mice. Remarkably, all seven genes showed corpus callosum defects,...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/YT4Ef38_xGg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Cooperative breeders feature the highest level of social complexity among vertebrates. Environmental constraints foster the evolution of this form of social organization, selecting for both well-developed social and ecological competences.

	<description>During embryonic development, Hox genes participate in the building of a functional digestive system in metazoans, and genetic conditions involving these genes lead to important, sometimes lethal, growth retardation. Recently, this phenotype was obtained after deletion of Haglr, the Hoxd antisense growth-associated long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) located between Hoxd1 and...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/EtxjZzTaqPA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Persistent directional cell migration is involved in animal development and diseases. The small GTPase Rac1 is involved in F-actin and focal adhesion dynamics. Local Rac1 activity is required for persistent directional migration, whereas global, hyperactivated Rac1 enhances random cell migration. Therefore, precise control of Rac1 activity is important for proper...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/FqFAA9cBHPo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study analyzed data from dopamine transporter (DAT) positron emission tomographic scans of 282 male patients with de novo Parkinson disease to investigate whether smoking impacts striatal dopamine neuronal degeneration. Mean DAT activity in the posterior (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.016) and ventral putamen (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.028) was higher in 44 current smokers in comparison to 105 ex-smokers and 133 never-smokers. The severity of baseline motor deficits and the longitudinal increases in levodopa-equivalent doses during follow-up were similar among the 3 groups. These results suggest that current smoking, but not past smoking, protects dopamine neuronal degeneration in the sensorimotor striatum with no additional clinical benefits.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral anticoagulation treatment (OAT) resumption is a therapeutic dilemma in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) care, particularly for lobar hemorrhages related to amyloid angiopathy. We sought to determine whether OAT resumption after ICH is associated with long-term outcome, accounting for ICH location (ie, lobar vs nonlobar).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We meta-analyzed individual patient data from: (1) the multicenter RETRACE study (n = 542), (2) a U.S.-based single-center ICH study (n = 261), and (3) the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage study (n = 209). We determined whether, within 1 year from ICH, OAT resumption was associated with: (1) mortality, (2) favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale = 0–3), and (3) stroke incidence. We separately analyzed nonlobar and lobar ICH cases using propensity score matching and Cox regression models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included 1,012 OAT-related ICH survivors (633 nonlobar and 379 lobar). Among nonlobar ICH survivors, 178/633 (28%) resumed OAT, whereas 86/379 (23%) lobar ICH survivors did. In multivariate analyses, OAT resumption after nonlobar ICH was associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.14–0.44, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and improved functional outcome (HR = 4.22, 95% CI = 2.57–6.94, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). OAT resumption after lobar ICH was also associated with decreased mortality (HR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.17–0.45, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and favorable functional outcome (HR = 4.08, 95% CI = 2.48–6.72, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, OAT resumption was associated with decreased all-cause stroke incidence in both lobar and nonlobar ICH (both &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25079-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest novel evidence of an association between OAT resumption and outcome following ICH, regardless of hematoma location. These findings support conducting randomized trials to explore risks and benefits of OAT resumption after ICH. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Traumatic brain injury in the prodromal period of Parkinson's disease: A large epidemiological study using medicare data</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25074-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest a greater risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but it is possible that the risk of TBI is greater in the prodromal period of PD. We aimed to examine the time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period compared to population-based controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25074-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified 89,790 incident PD cases and 118,095 comparable controls aged &amp;gt; 65 years in 2009 using Medicare claims data. Using data from the preceding 5 years, we compared time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period to controls. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for TBI in a Cox regression, while adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, modified Charlson comorbidity index, smoking, and alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25074-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of TBI was greater in PD patients in their prodromal period across all age and sex groups, with HRs consistently increasing with proximity to PD diagnosis. HRs ranged from 1.64 (95% CI, 1.52, 1.77) 5 years preceding diagnosis to 3.93 (95% CI, 3.74, 4.13) in the year before. The interaction between PD, TBI, and time was primarily observed for TBI attributed to falls. Motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment, suggested by corresponding International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes, partially mediated the PD-TBI association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25074-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a strong association between PD and a recent TBI in the prodromal period of PD. This association strengthens as PD diagnosis approaches and may be a result of undetected nonmotor and motor symptoms, but confirmation will be required.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25070-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical and radiological data of 42 Italian patients with PML were analyzed. Patient's data are available until 12 months after PML diagnosis. PLEX and steroids treatment as time-dependent covariates were entered in: (1) a Cox model to investigate their impact on full-blown PML-IRIS latency; (2) an analysis of variance ANOVA to investigate their impact on IRIS duration; and (3) a linear mixed model to assess their impact on the longitudinal clinical course (measured by means of Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25070-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment with PLEX was not associated to PML-IRIS latency (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.05; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.92), but once IRIS emerged, its duration was significantly longer in patients who underwent PLEX (101 vs 54 days in PLEX&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and PLEX&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; patients; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.028). Receiving proST versus therST was not associated to IRIS latency (HR = 0.67; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.39) or duration (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.95). Patients who underwent proST had a significantly higher EDSS increase during PML (0.09 EDSS points per month; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04) as compared to those who had therST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

New architectures of multilayer artificial neural networks and new methods for training them are rapidly revolutionizing the application of machine learning in diverse fields, including business, social science, physical sciences, and biology. Interpreting deep neural networks, however, currently remains elusive, and a critical challenge lies in understanding which meaningful features a network is actually learning. We present a general method for interpreting deep neural networks and extracting network-learned features from input data. We describe our algorithm in the context of biological sequence analysis. Our approach, based on ideas from statistical physics, samples from the maximum entropy distribution over possible sequences, anchored at an input sequence and subject to constraints implied by the empirical function learned by a network. Using our framework, we demonstrate that local transcription factor binding motifs can be identified from a network trained on ChIP-seq data and that nucleosome positioning signals are indeed learned by a network trained on chemical cleavage nucleosome maps. Imposing a further constraint on the maximum entropy distribution also allows us to probe whether a network is learning global sequence features, such as the high GC content in nucleosome-rich regions. This work thus provides valuable mathematical tools for interpreting and extracting learned features from feed-forward neural networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MhCI5bHA8f8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Concerted regulation of npc2 binding to endosomal/lysosomal membranes by bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate and sphingomyelin</title>

Niemann-Pick Protein C2 (npc2) is a small soluble protein critical for cholesterol transport within and from the lysosome and the late endosome. Intriguingly, npc2-mediated cholesterol transport has been shown to be modulated by lipids, yet the molecular mechanism of npc2-membrane interactions has remained elusive. Here, based on an extensive set of atomistic simulations and free energy calculations, we clarify the mechanism and energetics of npc2-membrane binding and characterize the roles of physiologically relevant key lipids associated with the binding process. Our results capture in atomistic detail two competitively favorable membrane binding orientations of npc2 with a low interconversion barrier. The first binding mode (&lt;i&gt;Prone&lt;/i&gt;) places the cholesterol binding pocket in direct contact with the membrane and is characterized by membrane insertion of a loop (V59-M60-G61-I62-P63-V64-P65). This mode is associated with cholesterol uptake and release. On the other hand, the second mode (&lt;i&gt;Supine&lt;/i&gt;) places the cholesterol binding pocket away from the membrane surface, but has overall higher membrane binding affinity. We determined that bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (bmp) is specifically required for strong membrane binding in &lt;i&gt;Prone mode&lt;/i&gt;, and that it cannot be substituted by other anionic lipids. Meanwhile, sphingomyelin counteracts bmp by hindering &lt;i&gt;Prone mode&lt;/i&gt; without affecting &lt;i&gt;Supine mode&lt;/i&gt;. Our results provide concrete evidence that lipids modulate npc2-mediated cholesterol transport either by favoring or disfavoring &lt;i&gt;Prone mode&lt;/i&gt; and that they impose this by modulating the accessibility of bmp for interacting with npc2. Overall, we provide a mechanism by which npc2-mediated cholesterol transport is controlled by the membrane composition and how npc2-lipid interactions can regulate the transport rate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TGPq0WeeVRQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A method to quantify mechanobiologic forces during zebrafish cardiac development using 4-D light sheet imaging and computational modeling</title>

Blood flow and mechanical forces in the ventricle are implicated in cardiac development and trabeculation. However, the mechanisms of mechanotransduction remain elusive. This is due in part to the challenges associated with accurately quantifying mechanical forces in the developing heart. We present a novel computational framework to simulate cardiac hemodynamics in developing zebrafish embryos by coupling 4-D light sheet imaging with a stabilized finite element flow solver, and extract time-dependent mechanical stimuli data. We employ deformable image registration methods to segment the motion of the ventricle from high resolution 4-D light sheet image data. This results in a robust and efficient workflow, as segmentation need only be performed at one cardiac phase, while wall position in the other cardiac phases is found by image registration. Ventricular hemodynamics are then quantified by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations in the moving wall domain with our validated flow solver. We demonstrate the applicability of the workflow in wild type zebrafish and three treated fish types that disrupt trabeculation: (a) chemical treatment using AG1478, an &lt;i&gt;ErbB2&lt;/i&gt; signaling inhibitor that inhibits proliferation and differentiation of cardiac trabeculation; (b) injection of &lt;i&gt;gata1a morpholino oligomer&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;gata1aMO&lt;/i&gt;) suppressing hematopoiesis and resulting in attenuated trabeculation; (c) &lt;i&gt;weak-atrium&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m58&lt;/sup&gt; mutant (&lt;i&gt;wea&lt;/i&gt;) with inhibited atrial contraction leading to a highly undeveloped ventricle and poor cardiac function. Our simulations reveal elevated wall shear stress (WSS) in wild type and AG1478 compared to &lt;i&gt;gata1aMO&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;wea&lt;/i&gt;. High oscillatory shear index (OSI) in the grooves between trabeculae, compared to lower values on the ridges, in the wild type suggest oscillatory forces as a possible regulatory mechanism of cardiac trabeculation development. The framework has broad applicability for future cardiac developmental studies focused on quantitatively investigating the role of hemodynamic forces and mechanotransduction during morphogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s3JXVOr7ED4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A mechanistic spatio-temporal framework for modelling individual-to-individual transmission—With an application to the 2014-2015 West Africa Ebola outbreak</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Max S. Y. Lau, Gavin J. Gibson, Hola Adrakey, Amanda McClelland, Steven Riley, Jon Zelner, George Streftaris, Sebastian Funk, Jessica Metcalf, Benjamin D. Dalziel, Bryan T. Grenfell&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years there has been growing availability of individual-level spatio-temporal disease data, particularly due to the use of modern communicating devices with GPS tracking functionality. These detailed data have been proven useful for inferring disease transmission to a more refined level than previously. However, there remains a lack of statistically sound frameworks to model the underlying transmission dynamic in a mechanistic manner. Such a development is particularly crucial for enabling a general epidemic predictive framework at the individual level. In this paper we propose a new statistical framework for mechanistically modelling individual-to-individual disease transmission in a landscape with heterogeneous population density. Our methodology is first tested using simulated datasets, validating our inferential machinery. The methodology is subsequently applied to data that describes a regional Ebola outbreak in Western Africa (2014-2015). Our results show that the methods are able to obtain estimates of key epidemiological parameters that are broadly consistent with the literature, while revealing a significantly shorter distance of transmission. More importantly, in contrast to existing approaches, we are able to perform a more general model prediction that takes into account the susceptible population. Finally, our results show that, given reasonable scenarios, the framework can be an effective surrogate for susceptible-explicit individual models which are often computationally challenging.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/379_g33xDYY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A clinical predictive score for postoperative myasthenic crisis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25087</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease mostly caused by autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptor (AChR) associated with thymus abnormalities. Thymectomy has been proven to be an efficacious treatment for patients with MG, but postoperative myasthenic crisis often occurs and is a major complication. We aimed to develop and validate a simple scoring system based on clinical characteristics in the preoperative status to predict the risk of postoperative myasthenic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We studied 393 patients with MG who underwent thymectomy at six tertiary centers in Japan (275 patients for derivation and 118 for validation). Clinical characteristics, such as gender, age at onset and operation, body mass index, disease duration, MG subtype, severity, symptoms, preoperative therapy, operative data, and laboratory data, were reviewed retrospectively. A multivariate logistic regression with LASSO penalties was used to determine the factors associated with postoperative myasthenic crisis and score was assigned. Finally, the predictive score was evaluated using bootstrapping technique in the derivation and validation group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Multivariate logistic regression identified three clinical factors for predicting postoperative myasthenic crisis risk: (1) vital capacity &amp;lt; 80%, (2) disease duration &amp;lt; 3 months, and (3) bulbar symptoms immediately before thymectomy. The postoperative myasthenic crisis predictive score, ranging from 0 to 6 points, had areas under the curve of 0.84 (0.66 – 0.96) in the derivation group and 0.80 (0.62 – 0.95) in the validation group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: A simple scoring system based on three preoperative clinical characteristics can predict the possibility of postoperative myasthenic crisis.

	<description>The brain has the ability to sense, coordinate, and respond to environmental changes through biological processes involving activity-dependent gene expression. cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs) have recently emerged as novel transcriptional regulators of essential biological functions, while their deregulation is linked to age-related human diseases. In the brain, CRTCs are unique signaling factors that act as sensors and integrators of hormonal, metabolic, and neural signals contributing to brain plasticity and brain–body communication.</description>

Orientation preference maps (OPMs) are present in carnivores (such as cats and ferrets) and primates but are absent in rodents. In this study we investigate the possible link between astrocyte arbors and presence of OPMs. We simulate the development of orientation maps with varying hypercolumn widths using a variant of the Laterally Interconnected Synergetically Self-Organizing Map (LISSOM) model, the Gain Control Adaptive Laterally connected (GCAL) model, with an additional layer simulating astrocytic activation. The synaptic activity of V1 neurons is given as input to the astrocyte layer. The activity of this astrocyte layer is now used to modulate bidirectional plasticity of lateral excitatory connections in the V1 layer. By simply varying the radius of the astrocytes, the extent of lateral excitatory neuronal connections can be manipulated. An increase in the radius of lateral excitatory connections subsequently increases the size of a single hypercolumn in the OPM. When these lateral excitatory connections become small enough the OPM disappears and a salt-and-pepper organization emerges.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Qa6CliFsDxQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Point process analysis of noise in early invertebrate vision</title>

Noise is a prevalent and sometimes even dominant aspect of many biological processes. While many natural systems have adapted to attenuate or even usefully integrate noise, the variability it introduces often still delimits the achievable precision across biological functions. This is particularly so for visual phototransduction, the process responsible for converting photons of light into usable electrical signals (quantum bumps). Here, randomness of both the photon inputs (regarded as extrinsic noise) and the conversion process (intrinsic noise) are seen as two distinct, independent and significant limitations on visual reliability. Past research has attempted to quantify the relative effects of these noise sources by using approximate methods that do not fully account for the discrete, point process and time ordered nature of the problem. As a result the conclusions drawn from these different approaches have led to inconsistent expositions of phototransduction noise performance.
This paper provides a fresh and complete analysis of the relative impact of intrinsic and extrinsic noise in invertebrate phototransduction using minimum mean squared error reconstruction techniques based on Bayesian point process (Snyder) filters. An integrate-fire based algorithm is developed to reliably estimate photon times from quantum bumps and Snyder filters are then used to causally estimate random light intensities both at the front and back end of the phototransduction cascade. Comparison of these estimates reveals that the dominant noise source transitions from extrinsic to intrinsic as light intensity increases. By extending the filtering techniques to account for delays, it is further found that among the intrinsic noise components, which include bump latency (mean delay and jitter) and shape (amplitude and width) variance, it is the mean delay that is critical to noise performance. As the timeliness of visual information is important for real-time action, this delay could potentially limit the speed at which invertebrates can respond to stimuli. Consequently, if one wants to increase visual fidelity, reducing the photoconversion lag is much more important than improving the regularity of the electrical signal.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ArMoUPqphhA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Unified thalamic model generates multiple distinct oscillations with state-dependent entrainment by stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005797</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Guoshi Li, Craig S. Henriquez, Flavio Fröhlich&lt;/p&gt;

The thalamus plays a critical role in the genesis of thalamocortical oscillations, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To understand whether the isolated thalamus can generate multiple distinct oscillations, we developed a biophysical thalamic model to test the hypothesis that generation of and transition between distinct thalamic oscillations can be explained as a function of neuromodulation by acetylcholine (ACh) and norepinephrine (NE) and afferent synaptic excitation. Indeed, the model exhibited four distinct thalamic rhythms (delta, sleep spindle, alpha and gamma oscillations) that span the physiological states corresponding to different arousal levels from deep sleep to focused attention. Our simulation results indicate that generation of these distinct thalamic oscillations is a result of both intrinsic oscillatory cellular properties and specific network connectivity patterns. We then systematically varied the ACh/NE and input levels to generate a complete map of the different oscillatory states and their transitions. Lastly, we applied periodic stimulation to the thalamic network and found that entrainment of thalamic oscillations is highly state-dependent. Our results support the hypothesis that ACh/NE modulation and afferent excitation define thalamic oscillatory states and their response to brain stimulation. Our model proposes a broader and more central role of the thalamus in the genesis of multiple distinct thalamo-cortical rhythms than previously assumed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jkr-v4uEYyk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling the adenosine system as a modulator of cognitive performance and sleep patterns during sleep restriction and recovery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005759</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew J. K. Phillips, Elizabeth B. Klerman, James P. Butler&lt;/p&gt;

Sleep loss causes profound cognitive impairments and increases the concentrations of adenosine and adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in specific regions of the brain. Time courses for performance impairment and recovery differ between acute and chronic sleep loss, but the physiological basis for these time courses is unknown. Adenosine has been implicated in pathways that generate sleepiness and cognitive impairments, but existing mathematical models of sleep and cognitive performance do not explicitly include adenosine. Here, we developed a novel receptor-ligand model of the adenosine system to test the hypothesis that changes in both adenosine and A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor concentrations can capture changes in cognitive performance during acute sleep deprivation (one prolonged wake episode), chronic sleep restriction (multiple nights with insufficient sleep), and subsequent recovery. Parameter values were estimated using biochemical data and reaction time performance on the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT). The model closely fit group-average PVT data during acute sleep deprivation, chronic sleep restriction, and recovery. We tested the model’s ability to reproduce timing and duration of sleep in a separate experiment where individuals were permitted to sleep for up to 14 hours per day for 28 days. The model accurately reproduced these data, and also correctly predicted the possible emergence of a split sleep pattern (two distinct sleep episodes) under these experimental conditions. Our findings provide a physiologically plausible explanation for observed changes in cognitive performance and sleep during sleep loss and recovery, as well as a new approach for predicting sleep and cognitive performance under planned schedules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MU1tBjfUi9Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Alexopoulos, Tomas Olsson, Roland Martin, Friedemann Paul, Jesper Tegnér, Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo, Pablo Villoslada&lt;/p&gt;

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease driving inflammatory and degenerative processes that damage the central nervous system (CNS). However, it is not well understood how these events interact and evolve to evoke such a highly dynamic and heterogeneous disease. We established a hypothesis whereby the variability in the course of MS is driven by the very same pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the disease, the autoimmune attack on the CNS that leads to chronic inflammation, neuroaxonal degeneration and remyelination. We propose that each of these processes acts more or less severely and at different times in each of the clinical subgroups. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model that was constrained by experimental data (the expanded disability status scale [EDSS] time series) obtained from a retrospective longitudinal cohort of 66 MS patients with a long-term follow-up (up to 20 years). Moreover, we validated this model in a second prospective cohort of 120 MS patients with a three-year follow-up, for which EDSS data and brain volume time series were available. The clinical heterogeneity in the datasets was reduced by grouping the EDSS time series using an unsupervised clustering analysis. We found that by adjusting certain parameters, albeit within their biological range, the mathematical model reproduced the different disease courses, supporting the dynamic CNS damage hypothesis to explain MS heterogeneity. Our analysis suggests that the irreversible axon degeneration produced in the early stages of progressive MS is mainly due to the higher rate of myelinated axon degeneration, coupled to the lower capacity for remyelination. However, and in agreement with recent pathological studies, degeneration of chronically demyelinated axons is not a key feature that distinguishes this phenotype. Moreover, the model reveals that lower rates of axon degeneration and more rapid remyelination make relapsing MS more resilient than the progressive subtype. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis of a common pathogenesis for the different MS subtypes, even in the presence of genetic and environmental heterogeneity. Hence, MS can be considered as a single disease in which specific dynamics can provoke a variety of clinical outcomes in different patient groups. These results have important implications for the design of therapeutic interventions for MS at different stages of the disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Lq5z41rWIc4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With division on the basis of the patients' phenotype, fibroblasts from slowly progressing patients could be separated from rapidly progressing patients by increase in sulfamidase activity when cultured at 30 °C (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, sensitivity = 96%, specificity = 93%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This method may provide an essential tool for assessment of treatment effects and for health care and life planning decisions. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25068-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-six patients diagnosed with MS based on the 2010 McDonald criteria (34 with the relapsing–remitting form, 2 with clinically isolated syndrome) with and without disease-modifying treatment were compared to 35 healthy age-/sex-matched volunteers. All patients underwent detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations. Three Tesla MRN with large anatomical coverage of both legs and the lumbosacral plexus was performed by using 2-dimensional (2D) fat-saturated, T2-weighted (T2w) and dual echo turbo spin echo sequences as well as a 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence. Besides qualitative visual nerve assessment, a T2w signal quantification was performed by calculation of proton spin density and T2 relaxation time. Nerve diameter was measured as a morphometric criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25068-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;T2w hyperintense nerve lesions were detectable in all MS patients, with a mean lesion number at thigh level of 151.5 ± 5.7 versus 19.1 ± 2.4 in controls (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Nerve proton spin density was higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8 ± 7.7/368.9 ± 8.2) versus controls (tibial/peroneal: 266.0 ± 11.0/276.8 ± 9.7, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). In contrast, T2 relaxation time was significantly higher in controls (tibial/peroneal: 82.0 ± 2.1/78.3 ± 1.7) versus MS (tibial/peroneal: 64.3 ± 1.0/61.2 ± 0.9, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Proximal tibial and peroneal nerve caliber was higher in MS (tibial: 52.4 ± 2.1mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, peroneal: 25.4 ± 1.3mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) versus controls (tibial: 45.2 ± 1.4mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0015; peroneal: 21.3 ± 0.7mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0049).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25068-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve lesions could be visualized and quantified in MS in vivo by high-resolution MRN. Lesions are defined by an increase of proton spin density and a decrease of T2 relaxation time, indicating changes in the microstructural organization of the extracellular matrix in peripheral nerve tissue in MS. By showing involvement of the peripheral nervous system in MS, this proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of MS.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25071-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified 430 individuals along the cognitive continuum aged &amp;gt;60 years with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. A subset of 329 individuals had fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. We ascertained presently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records and used the summation of presence/absence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke as a surrogate for vascular health. We used global amyloid from Pittsburgh compound B PET, entorhinal cortex tau uptake (ERC-tau) from tau-PET, and neurodegeneration in AD signature regions from MRI and FDG-PET as surrogates for AD pathophysiology. We dichotomized participants into CMC = 0 (CMC&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) versus CMC &amp;gt; 0 (CMC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and tested for age-adjusted group differences in AD biomarkers. Using structural equation models (SEMs), we assessed the impact of vascular health on AD biomarker cascade (amyloid leads to tau leads to neurodegeneration) after considering the direct and indirect age, sex, and apolipoprotein E effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25071-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;CMC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; participants had significantly greater neurodegeneration than CMC&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; participants but did not differ by amyloid or ERC-tau. The SEMs showed that (1) vascular health had a significant direct and indirect impact on neurodegeneration but not on amyloid; and (2) vascular health, specifically the presence of hyperlipidemia, had a significant direct impact on ERC-tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the relationship between tau deposition and vascular health. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pooled analysis of the HLA-DRB1 by smoking interaction in Parkinson disease</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25065-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory response plays an important role in Parkinson disease (PD). Previous studies have reported an association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-&lt;em&gt;DRB1&lt;/em&gt; and the risk of PD. There has also been growing interest in investigating whether inflammation-related genes interact with environmental factors such as smoking to influence PD risk. We performed a pooled analysis of the interaction between &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; and smoking in PD in 3 population-based case–control studies from Denmark and France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25065-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included 2,056 cases and 2,723 controls from 3 PD studies (Denmark, France) that obtained information on smoking through interviews. Genotyping of the rs660895 polymorphism in the &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; region was based on saliva or blood DNA samples. To assess interactions, we used logistic regression with product terms between rs660895 and smoking. We performed random-effects meta-analysis of marginal associations and interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25065-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both carrying rs660895-G (AG vs AA: odds ratio [OR] = 0.81; GG vs AA: OR = 0.56; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-trend = 0.003) and ever smoking (OR = 0.56, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) were inversely associated with PD. A multiplicative interaction was observed between rs660895 and smoking using codominant, additive (interaction parameter = 1.37, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005), and dominant (interaction parameter = 1.54, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001) genetic models without any heterogeneity (&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;² = 0.0%); the inverse association of rs660895-(AG+GG) with PD seen in never smokers (OR = 0.64, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) disappeared among ever smokers (OR = 1.00, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.99). Similar interactions were observed when we investigated light and heavy smokers separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25065-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study provides the first evidence that smoking modifies the previously reported inverse association of rs660895-G with PD, and suggests that smoking and &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; are involved in common pathways, possibly related to neuroinflammation.

How neuronal diversity emerges from complex patterns of gene expression remains poorly understood. Here we present an approach to understand electrophysiological diversity through gene expression by integrating pooled- and single-cell transcriptomics with intracellular electrophysiology. Using neuroinformatics methods, we compiled a brain-wide dataset of 34 neuron types with paired gene expression and intrinsic electrophysiological features from publically accessible sources, the largest such collection to date. We identified 420 genes whose expression levels significantly correlated with variability in one or more of 11 physiological parameters. We next trained statistical models to infer cellular features from multivariate gene expression patterns. Such models were predictive of gene-electrophysiological relationships in an independent collection of 12 visual cortex cell types from the Allen Institute, suggesting that these correlations might reflect general principles relating expression patterns to phenotypic diversity across very different cell types. Many associations reported here have the potential to provide new insights into how neurons generate functional diversity, and correlations of ion channel genes like &lt;i&gt;Gabrd&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt; (Nav1.1) with resting potential and spiking frequency are consistent with known causal mechanisms. Our work highlights the promise and inherent challenges in using cell type-specific transcriptomics to understand the mechanistic origins of neuronal diversity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mxjWoj2tlEo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Un-gating and allosteric modulation of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel captured by molecular dynamics</title>

Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) mediate intercellular communication at synapses through the opening of an ion pore in response to the binding of a neurotransmitter. Despite the increasing availability of high-resolution structures of pLGICs, a detailed understanding of the functional isomerization from closed to open (gating) and back is currently missing. Here, we provide the first atomistic description of the transition from open to closed (un-gating) in the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) from &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis Elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Starting with the active-state structure solved in complex with the neurotransmitter L-glutamate and the positive allosteric modulator (PAM) ivermectin, we analyze the spontaneous relaxation of the channel upon removal of ivermectin by explicit solvent/membrane Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;s-long trajectories support the conclusion that ion-channel deactivation is mediated by two distinct quaternary transitions, i.e. a global receptor twisting followed by the radial expansion (or blooming) of the extracellular domain. At variance with previous models, we show that pore closing is exclusively regulated by the global twisting, which controls the position of the &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;2 loop relative to the M2-M3 loop at the EC/TM domain interface. Additional simulations with L-glutamate restrained to the crystallographic binding mode and ivermectin removed indicate that the same twisting isomerization is regulated by agonist binding at the orthosteric site. These results provide a structural model for gating in pLGICs and suggest a plausible mechanism for the pharmacological action of PAMs in this neurotransmitter receptor family. The simulated un-gating converges to the X-ray structure of GluCl resting state both globally and locally, demonstrating the predictive character of state-of-art MD simulations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YaGafPEqC8U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by James Rankin, Frédéric Chavane&lt;/p&gt;

Voltage-sensitive dye imaging experiments in primary visual cortex (V1) have shown that local, oriented visual stimuli elicit stable orientation-selective activation within the stimulus retinotopic footprint. The cortical activation dynamically extends far beyond the retinotopic footprint, but the peripheral spread stays non-selective—a surprising finding given a number of anatomo-functional studies showing the orientation specificity of long-range connections. Here we use a computational model to investigate this apparent discrepancy by studying the expected population response using known published anatomical constraints. The dynamics of input-driven localized states were simulated in a planar neural field model with multiple sub-populations encoding orientation. The realistic connectivity profile has parameters controlling the clustering of long-range connections and their orientation bias. We found substantial overlap between the anatomically relevant parameter range and a steep decay in orientation selective activation that is consistent with the imaging experiments. In this way our study reconciles the reported orientation bias of long-range connections with the functional expression of orientation selective neural activity. Our results demonstrate this sharp decay is contingent on three factors, that long-range connections are sufficiently diffuse, that the orientation bias of these connections is in an intermediate range (consistent with anatomy) and that excitation is sufficiently balanced by inhibition. Conversely, our modelling results predict that, for reduced inhibition strength, spurious orientation selective activation could be generated through long-range lateral connections. Furthermore, if the orientation bias of lateral connections is very strong, or if inhibition is particularly weak, the network operates close to an instability leading to unbounded cortical activation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AlzACQQ1LC8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Autophagy is a physiological process for the recycling and degradation of cellular materials. Forming the autophagosome from the phagophore, a cup-shaped double-membrane vesicle, is a critical step in autophagy. The origin of the cup shape of the phagophore is poorly understood. In yeast, fusion of a small number of Atg9-containing vesicles is considered a key step in autophagosome biogenesis, aided by Atg1 complexes (ULK1 in mammals) localized at the preautophagosomal structure (PAS). In particular, the S-shaped Atg17-Atg31-Atg29 subcomplex of Atg1 is critical for phagophore nucleation at the PAS. To study this process, we simulated membrane remodeling processes in the presence and absence of membrane associated Atg17. We show that at least three vesicles need to fuse to induce the phagophore shape, consistent with experimental observations. However, fusion alone is not sufficient. Interactions with 34-nm long, S-shaped Atg17 complexes are required to overcome a substantial kinetic barrier in the transition to the cup-shaped phagophore. Our finding rationalizes the recruitment of Atg17 complexes to the yeast PAS, and their unusual shape. In control simulations without Atg17, with weakly binding Atg17, or with straight instead of S-shaped Atg17, the membrane shape transition did not occur. We confirm the critical role of Atg17-membrane interactions experimentally by showing that mutations of putative membrane interaction sites result in reduction or loss of autophagic activity in yeast. Fusion of a small number of vesicles followed by Atg17-guided membrane shape-remodeling thus emerges as a viable route to phagophore formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Gou_spmEWOQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Microglial dysfunction as a key pathologic change in adrenomyeloneuropathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25085</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25085</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Mutations in ABCD1 cause the neurodegenerative disease adrenoleukodystrophy, which manifests as the spinal cord axonopathy adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) in nearly all males surviving into adulthood. Microglial dysfunction has long been implicated in pathogenesis of brain disease but its role in the spinal cord is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We assessed spinal cord microglia in humans and mice with AMN and investigated the role of ABCD1 in microglial activity toward neuronal phagocytosis in cell culture. As mutations in ABCD1 lead to incorporation of very long chain fatty acids into phospholipids, we separately examined the effects of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) upon microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Within the spinal cord of humans and mice with AMN, upregulation of several phagocytosis-related markers such as MFGE8 and TREM2 precedes complement activation and synapse loss. Unexpectedly, this occurs in the absence of overt inflammation. LPC C26:0 added to ABCD1-deficient microglia in culture further enhances MFGE8 expression, aggravates phagocytosis and leads to neuronal injury. Furthermore, exposure to a MFGE8 blocking antibody reduces phagocytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Spinal cord microglia lacking ABCD1 are primed for phagocytosis, affecting neurons within an altered metabolic milieu. Blocking phagocytosis or specific phagocytic receptors may alleviate synapse loss and axonal degeneration. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region for gait recovery after stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25086</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: One-third of all stroke survivors are unable to walk, even after intensive physiotherapy. Thus, other concepts to restore walking are needed. Since electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) is known to elicit gait movements, this area might be a promising target for restorative neurostimulation in stroke patients with gait disability. The present study aims to delineate the effect of high-frequency stimulation of the MLR (MLR-HFS) on gait impairment in a rodent stroke model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Male Wistar rats underwent photothrombotic stroke of the right sensorimotor cortex and chronic implantation of a stimulating electrode into the right MLR. Gait was assessed using clinical scoring of the beam walking test and videokinematic analysis (CatWalk™) at baseline and on days 3 and 4 after experimental stroke with and without MLR-HFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Kinematic analysis revealed significant changes in several dynamic and static gait parameters resulting in overall reduced gait velocity. All rats exhibited major coordination deficits during the beam walking challenge and were unable to cross the beam. Simultaneous to the onset of MLR-HFS, a significantly higher walking speed and improvements in several dynamic gait parameters were detected by the Catwalk™-system. Rats regained the ability to cross the beam unassisted showing a reduced number of paw slips and misses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: MLR-HFS can improve disordered locomotor function in a rodent stroke model. It may act by shielding brainstem and spinal locomotor centers from abnormal cortical input after stroke, thus allowing for compensatory and independent action of these circuits.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stereo-electroencephalography and surgical outcome in polymicrogyria-related epilepsy: A multi-centric study</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;: We aimed to 1) assess the concordance between various PMG types and the associated epileptogenic zone (EZ), as defined by stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG), and 2) determine the postsurgical seizure outcome in PMG-related drug-resistant epilepsy. &lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: We retrospectively analyzed 58 cases: 49 had SEEG and 39 corticectomy or hemispherotomy. &lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: Mean age at SEEG or surgery was 28.3 years (range 2-50). PMG was bilateral in 9 (16%) patients and unilateral in 49, including 17 (29%) unilobar, 12 (21%) multilobar, 15 (26%) perisylvian, and only 5 (9%) hemispheric. Twenty-eight (48%) patients additionally had schizencephaly, heterotopia or focal cortical dysplasia. The SEEG-determined EZ was fully concordant with the PMG in only 8 (16%) cases, partially concordant in 74% and discordant in 10%. The EZ included remote cortical areas in 21 (43%) cases and was primarily localized in those in 5 (10%), all related to the mesial temporal structures. All but one PMG patients with corticectomy or hemispherotomy had a unilateral PMG. At last follow-up (mean 4.6 years, range 1-16), 28 (72%) patients remained seizure free. Shorter epilepsy duration to surgery was an independent predictor of seizure freedom. &lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;: PMG-related drug-resistant epilepsy warrants a comprehensive presurgical evaluation, including SEEG investigations in most cases, since the EZ may only partially overlap with the PMG or include solely remote cortical areas. Seizure freedom is feasible in a large proportion of patients. PMG extent should not deter from exploring the possibility of epilepsy surgery. Our data support the early consideration of epilepsy surgery in this patient group. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A recessive ataxia diagnosis algorithm for the next-generation sequencing era</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25084</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Differential diagnosis of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias can be challenging. A ranking algorithm that predicts the molecular diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype of a patient has been developed to guide genetic testing and to align genetic findings with the clinical context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: An algorithm that follows clinical practice, including patient history, clinical, MRI, electromyography and biomarker features, was developed following a review of the literature on 67 autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias and personal clinical experience. Frequency and specificity of each feature were defined for each autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, and corresponding prediction scores assigned. Clinical and paraclinical features of patients are entered into the algorithm, and a patient's total score for each autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia is calculated, producing a ranking of possible diagnoses. Sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm were assessed by blinded analysis of a multinational cohort of 834 patients with molecularly confirmed autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia. The performance of the algorithm was assessed versus a blinded panel of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: The correct diagnosis was ranked within the top 3 highest-scoring diagnoses at a sensitivity or specificity of &amp;gt;90% for 84% and 91% of the evaluated genes, respectively. Mean sensitivity and specificity of the top 3 highest-scoring diagnoses were 92% and 95%, respectively. The algorithm outperformed the panel of ataxia experts (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our algorithm is highly sensitive and specific, accurately predicting the underlying molecular diagnoses of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias, thereby guiding targeted sequencing or facilitating interpretation of next-generation sequencing data.

	<description>The brain changes as we age and these changes are associated with functional deterioration and neurodegenerative disease. It is vital that we better understand individual differences in the brain ageing process; hence, techniques for making individualised predictions of brain ageing have been developed. We present evidence supporting the use of neuroimaging-based ‘brain age’ as a biomarker of an individual’s brain health. Increasingly, research is showing how brain disease or poor physical health negatively impacts brain age.</description>

The authors reveal a core function for TRPA1 in noxious heat transduction based on sensing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ROS and demonstrate its conservation from planarians to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/ElW5YkvsSA0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thalamic inhibition regulates critical-period plasticity in visual cortex and thalamus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 16 October 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0002-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0002-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The critical period of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in the visual cortex is initiated by maturation of inhibition. The authors show that thalamic relay neurons in mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus also undergo OD plasticity. This process depends on thalamic inhibition and is required for consolidating the OD shift in visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/sWotsWoliwo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
