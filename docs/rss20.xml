	<title>The Cerebellum: Spinocerebellar Ataxia-Like Presentation of the M233V PSEN1 Mutation</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene is considered to be the most common gene, which is responsible for the development of an autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease with early onset and sometimes broad phenotype. We present a patient with a spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-like phenotype who was found to carry an M233V mutation. General and neurological exam was carried out. Brain MRI as well as genetic testing for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 were performed. The patient was then referred for a next-generation sequencing-based gene panel test with 723 genes included. A 26-year-old man of an Azerbaijani origin presented with a progressive impairment of coordination followed by memory impairment. Family history was positive for a similar disorder suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Brain MRI showed bilateral hippocampal atrophy (more pronounced in the left), as well as mild atrophy of the left temporoparietal cortex. Tests for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 came negative. Gene panel test showed c.697A &amp;gt; G heterozygous variant in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene leading to a M233V amino acid change, which was validated by a Sanger sequencing. So far, M233V mutation has not been associated with a combination of cerebellar and cognitive features at onset. Our case contributes to a better characterization of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations and expands the phenotype of the M233V carriers. We propose to consider &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations in patients presenting with an SCA-like phenotype but negative for common types of SCA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients with autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (CA) with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Abs) may lead to a better prognosis. Herein, we report prodromal transient neurological symptoms that should raise clinical suspicion of CA with GAD-Abs. We initially identified a 70-year-old man who presented a first acute episode of vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia lasting 2 weeks. Two months later, he experienced a similar episode along with new-onset gaze-evoked nystagmus. After 4 months, downbeat nystagmus, left limb dysmetria, and gait ataxia progressively appeared, and an autoimmune CA was diagnosed based on the positivity of GAD-Abs in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We searched retrospectively for similar presentations in a cohort of 31 patients diagnosed with CA and GAD-Abs. We found 11 (35.4%) patients (all women, median age 62 years; 8/11 [72.7%] with autoimmune comorbidities) with transient neurological symptoms antedating CA onset by a median of 3 months, including vertigo in 9 (81.8%; described as paroxysmal in 8) and fluctuating diplopia in 3 (27.3%) patients. The identification of transient neurological symptoms of unknown etiology, such as paroxysmal vertigo and fluctuating diplopia, should lead to GAD-Abs testing in serum and CSF, especially in patients with autoimmune comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by storage of unesterified glycolipids and cholesterol in lysosome. NPC’s clinical presentation is highly heterogeneous, depending on the time of onset. It encompasses visceral, neurological, and/or psychiatric manifestations. As the motor findings are so important and devastating in this disease, there is a lack of description about non-motor symptoms, even though they play important role in quality of life of NPC patients. We described the most common non-motor findings in NPC like cognitive dysfunction, neuroimaging, psychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, seizures, hearing problems, respiratory and other systemic features, bladder and fecal dysfunction, hypersalivation, and malnutrition. In this review, we highlighted the importance of these undervalued symptoms and their management. Specific measures of all aforementioned clinical features may work as relevant biomarkers in order to evaluate successful therapies in future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Upward Gaze Palsy: a Valuable Sign to Distinguish Spinocerebellar Ataxias</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01154-2</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) represent a large group of heredodegenerative diseases, with great phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity. However, in the clinical neurological practice, some symptoms and signs might help differentiate the SCAs. This study’s aims were to evaluate the frequency of upward gaze palsy (UGP) and investigate its role in assisting in the clinical differentiation of SCAs. We included 419 patients with SCAs (248 with SCA3, 95 with SCA10, 38 with SCA2, 22 with SCA1, 12 with SCA7, and 4 with SCA6). This study compared UGP with other known markers of disease severity—age of onset, disease duration, SARA score, and size of CAG expansion, and also other semiologic features, as bulging eyes. This sign was significantly more prevalent in SCA3 (64.11%), compared with SCA10 (3.16%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and other SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA7–11.84%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). UGP showed very high sensibility ins SCA3 (92.9), although lacking of specificity (64.1%). The odds ratio (OR) of UGP were also very high, 23.52 (95% CI 12.38–44.69), and was significantly correlated with larger CAG expansions, age, and disease duration in SCA3 patients, but not with age of onset or severity of the ataxic syndrome. This study showed that UGP is highly suggestive of SCA3 and has high sensitivity for the differential diagnosis among SCAs, and it could be of great value for bedside semiologic tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Feasibility and Acceptability of Lee Silverman Voice Treatment in Progressive Ataxias</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01153-3</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Communication difficulties have considerable impact on people with progressive ataxia, yet there are currently no evidence-based treatments. LSVT LOUD® focuses on the production of healthy vocal loudness whilst also improving breath support, vocal quality, loudness and articulation in participating patients. This study aimed to investigate whether Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD®) can improve communication effectiveness in these patients. We performed a rater-blinded, single-arm study investigating LSVT LOUD® treatment in a population of patients with progressive ataxia including Friedreich’s ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 18), spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), idiopathic cerebellar ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), and spastic paraplegia 7 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1). Twenty-one patients were recruited to the study, with 19 completing treatment. Sessions were administered via Skype in the LSVT-X format, meaning two sessions per week over a period of 8 weeks. Assessments included two baseline and two post-treatment measures and focused on outcome measures covering aspects ranging from physiological function to impact and participation. Results indicate improvements in patient-perceived outcomes for 14 of the 19 participants, in both speech and psychosocial domains. Speech data furthermore demonstrate significant improvements in prolonged vowel duration, and voice quality measures. Intelligibility and naturalness evaluations showed no change post-treatment. Patients reported high acceptability of the treatment itself, as well as administration by Skype. This is the largest treatment study for people with progressive ataxia published to date. It provides an indication that LSVT LOUD® can have a positive impact on communication in this patient group and could form the basis for larger-scale trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Treatment of Primary Autoimmune Cerebellar Ataxia with Mycophenolate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01152-4</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Immune-mediated ataxias account for a substantial number of sporadic otherwise idiopathic ataxias. Despite some well-characterised entities such as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration where diagnostic markers exist, the majority of immune ataxias remained undiagnosed and untreated. We present here our experience in the treatment of suspected primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA) using mycophenolate. All patients reported attend the Sheffield Ataxia Centre on a regular basis and had undergone extensive investigations, including genetic testing using next-generation sequencing, with other causes of ataxia excluded. The diagnosis of PACA was strongly suspected based on investigations, pattern of disease progression, and cerebellar involvement. Patients were treated with mycophenolate and monitored using MR spectroscopy of the cerebellar vermis. Thirty patients with PACA are reported here. Of these, 22 received mycophenolate (group 1). The remaining 8 were not on treatment (group 2-control group). Out of the 22 treated patients, 4 underwent serial MR spectroscopy prior to starting treatment and thus were used as controls making the total number of patients in the control group 12. The mean change of the MRS within the vermis (NAA/Cr area ratio) in the treatment group was + 0.144 ± 0.09 (improved) and in the untreated group − 0.155 ± 0.06 (deteriorated). The difference was significant. We also demonstrated a strong correlation between the spectroscopy and the SARA score. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of mycophenolate in the treatment of PACA. The results suggest that immune-mediated ataxias are potentially treatable, and that there is a need for early diagnosis to prevent permanent neurological deficit. The recently published diagnostic criteria for PACA would hopefully aid the diagnosis and treatment of this entity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Acoustic Speech Analytics Are Predictive of Cerebellar Dysfunction in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01151-5</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Speech production relies on motor control and cognitive processing and is linked to cerebellar function. In diseases where the cerebellum is impaired, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), speech abnormalities are common and can be detected by instrumental assessments. However, the potential of speech assessments to be used to monitor cerebellar impairment in MS remains unexplored. The aim of this study is to build an objectively measured speech score that reflects cerebellar function, pathology and quality of life in MS. Eighty-five people with MS and 21 controls participated in the study. Speech was independently assessed through objective acoustic analysis and blind expert listener ratings. Cerebellar function and overall disease disability were measured through validated clinical scores; cerebellar pathology was assessed via magnetic resonance imaging, and validated questionnaires informed quality of life. Selected speech variables were entered in a regression model to predict cerebellar function. The resulting model was condensed into one composite speech score and tested for prediction of abnormal 9-hole peg test (9HPT), and for correlations with the remaining cerebellar scores, imaging measurements and self-assessed quality of life. Slow rate of syllable repetition and increased free speech pause percentage were the strongest predictors of cerebellar impairment, complemented by phonatory instability. Those variables formed the acoustic composite score that accounted for 54% of variation in cerebellar function, correlated with cerebellar white matter volume (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.3, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p =&lt;/em&gt; 0.017), quality of life (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.5, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and predicted an abnormal 9HPT with 85% accuracy. An objective multi-feature speech metric was highly representative of motor cerebellar impairment in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Trehalose in Machado-Joseph Disease: Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01150-6</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01150-6</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is relatively prevalent among the Yemenite Jewish subpopulation living in Israel. Currently, there is no treatment able to modify the disease progression. Trehalose is a disaccharide with protein-stabilizing and autophagy-enhancing properties. In animal models of MJD, trehalose showed reduction of cerebellar lesion size and improved motor function. This study was designed to be a proof-of-concept, phase 2 study lasting 6 to 12 months, to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of weekly IV administration of 15 g or 30 g 10% trehalose solution in 14 MJD patients. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, which were assessed by various clinical and laboratory tests. Secondary endpoints were changes in the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score, Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar Ataxia (NESSCA), time to do 9-hole peg test (9HPT), time to do 8-meter walk (8MW), and quality of life assessed by the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF). Trehalose was well tolerated, and no serious drug-related adverse events were noted. The average SARA score, NESSCA, and time to do 9HPT and 8MW and the WHOQoL-BREF for all patients remained stable at 6 months. Six patients received treatment for as long as 12 months and continued to remain stable on all the above tests. IV trehalose seems to be safe in humans and probably effective to stabilize neurological impairment in MJD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: EMG Rectification Is Detrimental for Identifying Abnormalities in Corticomuscular and Intermuscular Coherence in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2</title>

	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01149-z</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence (CMC, IMC) reflect connectivity between neuronal activity in the motor cortex measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and muscular activity measured by electromyography (EMG), or between activity in different muscles, respectively. There is an ongoing debate on the appropriateness of EMG rectification prior to coherence estimation. This work examines the effects of EMG rectification in CMC and IMC estimation in 20 spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patients, 16 prodromal SCA2 gene mutation carriers, and 26 healthy controls during a repetitive upper or lower limb motor task. Coherence estimations were performed using the non-rectified raw EMG signal vs. the rectified EMG signal. EMG rectification decreases the level of significance of lower beta-frequency band CMC and IMC values in SCA2 patients and prodromal SCA2 mutation carriers vs. healthy controls, and also results in overall lower coherence values. EMG rectification is detrimental for beta-frequency band CMC and IMC estimation. One likely reason for this effect is distortion of coherence estimation in high-frequency signals, where the level of amplitude cancelation is high.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting learning of new motor tasks, which is an essential function for motor recovery. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the cerebellum can be used to enhance learning. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol, on visuo-motor learning in a sample of hemiparetic patients due to recent stroke in the territory of the contralateral middle cerebral artery. Eight stroke patients were enrolled for the purposes of the study in the chronic stage of recovery (i.e., at least 6 months after stroke). In two sessions, Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with real or sham c-iTBS applied over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected body side. c-iTBS was applied immediately before the learning phase of a visuo-motor adaptation task. Real, but not sham, c-iTBS improved visuo-motor learning as revealed by an increased performance in of the learning phase of the visuo-moto adaptation task. Moreover, we also found that real but not sham c-iTBS induced a sustained improvement in the re-adaptation of the recently learned skill (i.e., when patients were re-tested after 30 min). Taken together, these data point to c-iTBS as a potential novel strategy to promote motor learning in patients with stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Chromosomal microarray analysis is commonly used as screening test for children with neurodevelopmental issues, also in case of complex neurological phenotypes. Developmental delay/intellectual disability is a common presentation sign in pediatric ataxias, diseases with high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. In order to determine the diagnostic yield of Array-CGH in such conditions, all the tests performed in the last 10-year activity of a single referral center in children who present, besides the neurodevelopmental impairment, cerebellar abnormalities have been systematically gathered. The study demonstrates that, except for Dandy-Walker malformation or poly-malformative phenotypes, chromosomal microarray analysis should be discouraged as first-line diagnostic test in pediatric ataxias with neurodevelopmental disability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We sought to assess structural and functional patterns of cerebellum in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), and investigate the associations of structural and functional cerebellar gray matter abnormalities. We collected magnetic resonance imaging data of 18 patients with multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type) and 18 health control subjects. The gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients was assessed using voxel-based morphometry. And change in the connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks was assessed using resting-state functional MRI analysis. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between the extent of cerebellar atrophy and reduced-activation in the cerebellar-cortical and subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivities. We confirmed the gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients and found that the extent of cerebellar atrophy was correlated with decreased connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks, including the default, frontal parietal, and sensorimotor networks. The volume reduction in the motor cerebellum was closely associated with the clinical motor severity. A post hoc analysis showed reduced-activation in the subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivity without the subthalamic nucleus atrophy. These results emphasized significant atrophy in the cerebellar subsystem and its association with the large-scale cortical networks in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), which may improve our understanding of the neural pathophysiology mechanisms of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Are Vermal Lobules VI–VII Smaller in Autism Spectrum Disorder?</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar volume, in particular vermal lobule areas VI–VII, have been extensively researched in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although findings are often unclear. The aim of the present study is to consolidate all existing cerebellar and age data of individuals with ASD, and compare this data to typically developing (TD) controls. Raw data, or the means and standard deviations of cerebellar volume and age, were obtained from 17 studies (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellum&lt;/sub&gt;: 421 ASD and 370 TD participants; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VI–VII&lt;/sub&gt;: 506 ASD and 290 TD participants). Total cerebellar volume, or VI–VII area, was plotted against age and lines of fit of ASD and TD data were compared. Mean differences in cerebellar volume and VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants were then compared via ANCOVA analyses. Findings revealed multiple differences in VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants below 18 years of age. Additionally, cerebellar volume was greater in males with ASD than TD males between 2 and 4 years. In the present study, cerebellar volume and VI–VII area show different rates of change across age for those with autism compared with those without. These morphological differences provide a neurobiological justification to investigate related behavioural correlates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Shh-Mediated Increase in β-Catenin Levels Maintains Cerebellar Granule Neuron Progenitors in Proliferation</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) give rise to the cerebellar granule neurons in the developing cerebellum. Generation of large number of these neurons is made possible by the high proliferation rate of CGNPs in the external granule layer (EGL) in the dorsal cerebellum. Here, we show that upregulation of β-catenin can maintain murine CGNPs in a state of proliferation. Further, we show that β-catenin mRNA and protein levels can be regulated by the mitogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh signaling led to an increase in the level of the transcription factor N-myc. N-myc was found to bind the β-catenin promoter, and the increase in β-catenin mRNA and protein levels could be prevented by blocking N-myc upregulation downstream of Shh signaling. Furthermore, blocking Wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signaling by Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor Dickkopf 1 (Dkk-1) in the presence of Shh did not prevent the upregulation of β-catenin. We propose that in culture, Shh signaling regulates β-catenin expression through N-myc and results in increased CGNP proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This thesis is designed to be a self-contained exposition of the
neurobiological and mathematical aspects of sensory perception, memory, and
learning with a bias towards olfaction. The final chapters introduce a new
approach to modeling focusing more on the geometry of the system as opposed to
element wise dynamics. Additionally, we construct an organism independent model
for olfactory processing: something which is currently missing from the
literature.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02174</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02174</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a brain-inspired neural model that is very
promising for unsupervised learning, especially in embedded applications.
However, it is unable to learn efficient prototypes when dealing with complex
datasets. We propose in this work to improve the SOM performance by using
extracted features instead of raw data. We conduct a comparative study on the
SOM classification accuracy with unsupervised feature extraction using two
different approaches: a machine learning approach with Sparse Convolutional
Auto-Encoders using gradient-based learning, and a neuroscience approach with
Spiking Neural Networks using Spike Timing Dependant Plasticity learning. The
SOM is trained on the extracted features, then very few labeled samples are
used to label the neurons with their corresponding class. We investigate the
impact of the feature maps, the SOM size and the labeled subset size on the
classification accuracy using the different feature extraction methods. We
improve the SOM classification by +6.09\% and reach state-of-the-art
performance on unsupervised image classification.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We analyse the potential effects of lateral connectivity (amacrine cells and
gap junctions) on motion anticipation in the retina. Our main result is that
lateral connectivity can-under conditions analysed in the paper-trigger a wave
of activity enhancing the anticipation mechanism provided by local gain control
[8, 17]. We illustrate these predictions by two examples studied in the
experimental literature: differential motion sensitive cells [1] and direction
sensitive cells where direction sensitivity is inherited from asymmetry in gap
junctions connectivity [73]. We finally present reconstructions of retinal
responses to 2D visual inputs to assess the ability of our model to anticipate
motion in the case of three different 2D stimuli.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02038</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02038</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The relation between spontaneous and stimulated global brain activity is a
fundamental problem in the understanding of brain functions. This question is
investigated both theoretically and experimentally within the context of
nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relations. We consider the stochastic
coarse-grained Wilson-Cowan model in the linear noise approximation and compare
analytical results to experimental data from magnetoencephalography (MEG) of
human brain. The short time behavior of the autocorrelation function for
spontaneous activity is characterized by a double-exponential decay, with two
characteristic times, differing by two orders of magnitude. Conversely, the
response function exhibits a single exponential decay in agreement with
experimental data for evoked activity under visual stimulation. Results suggest
that the brain response to weak external stimuli can be predicted from the
observation of spontaneous activity and pave the way to controlled experiments
on the brain response under different external perturbations.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: An optimized pipeline for functional connectivity analysis in the rat brain. (arXiv:2001.09857v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09857</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a widespread and powerful tool for
investigating functional connectivity and brain disorders. However, functional
connectivity analysis can be seriously affected by random and structured noise
from non-neural sources such as physiology. Thus, it is essential to first
reduce thermal noise and then correctly identify and remove non-neural
artefacts from rs-fMRI signals through optimized data processing methods.
However, existing tools that correct for these effects have been developed for
human brain and are not readily transposable to rat data. Therefore, the aim of
the present study was to establish a data processing pipeline that can robustly
remove random and structured noise from rat rs-fMRI data. It includes a novel
denoising approach based on the Marchenko-Pastur Principle Component Analysis
(MP-PCA) method, FMRIB's ICA-based Xnoiseifier (FIX) for automatic artefact
classification and cleaning, and global signal regression. Our results show
that: I) MP-PCA denoising substantially improves the temporal signal-to-noise
ratio; II) the pre-trained FIX classifier achieves a high accuracy in artefact
classification; III) both artefact cleaning and global signal regression are
essential steps in minimizing the within-group variability in control animals
and identifying functional connectivity changes in a rat model of sporadic
Alzheimer's disease, as compared to controls.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12019</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12019</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a probabilistic approach to unify open set recognition with the
prevention of catastrophic forgetting in deep continual learning, based on
variational Bayesian inference. Our single model combines a joint probabilistic
encoder with a generative model and a linear classifier that get shared across
sequentially arriving tasks. In order to successfully distinguish unseen
unknown data from trained known tasks, we propose to bound the class specific
approximate posterior by fitting regions of high density on the basis of
correctly classified data points. These bounds are further used to
significantly alleviate catastrophic forgetting by avoiding samples from low
density areas in generative replay. Our approach requires neither storing of
old, nor upfront knowledge of future data, and is empirically validated on
visual and audio tasks in class incremental, as well as cross-dataset scenarios
across modalities.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Structural connectivity in the brain is typically studied by reducing its
observation to a single spatial resolution. However, the brain possesses a rich
architecture organized over multiple scales linked to one another. We explored
the multiscale organization of human connectomes using datasets of healthy
subjects reconstructed at five different resolutions. We found that the
structure of the human brain remains self-similar when the resolution of
observation is progressively decreased by hierarchical coarse-graining of the
anatomical regions. Strikingly, a geometric network model, where distances are
not Euclidean, predicts the multiscale properties of connectomes, including
self-similarity. The model relies on the application of a geometric
renormalization protocol which decreases the resolution by coarse-graining and
averaging over short similarity distances. Our results suggest that simple
organizing principles underlie the multiscale architecture of human structural
brain networks, where the same connectivity law dictates short- and long-range
connections between different brain regions over many resolutions. The
implications are varied and can be substantial for fundamental debates, such as
whether the brain is working near a critical point, as well as for applications
including advanced tools to simplify the digital reconstruction and simulation
of the brain.

	<description>The bacterial flagellar motor switches rotational directions between counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) to direct the migration of the cell. The cytoplasmic ring (C-ring) of the motor, which is composed of FliG, FliM, and FliN, is known for controlling the rotational sense of the flagellum. However, the mechanism underlying rotational switching remains elusive. Here, we deployed cryo-electron tomography to visualize the C-ring in two rotational biased mutants in &lt;i&gt;Vibrio alginolyticus&lt;/i&gt;. We determined the C-ring molecular architectures, providing novel insights into the mechanism of rotational switching. We report that the C-ring maintained 34-fold symmetry in both rotational senses and the protein composition remained constant. The two structures show FliG conformational changes elicit a large conformational rearrangement of the rotor complex that coincides with rotational switching of the flagellum. FliM and FliN form a stable spiral-shaped base of the C-ring, likely stabilizing the C-ring during the conformational remodeling.</description>

	<description>VPS10P (vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein) domain receptors are neuronal sorting receptors that direct cargo proteins to their destined location in subcellular compartments of the soma, dendrites, and the axon. Protein sorting by receptors such as SORLA, sortilin, and SorCS2 controls functional integrity and viability of neurons, whereas sorting receptor dysfunctions are linked to acute, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we discuss molecular mechanisms that define ligand repertoire and sorting path and that control plasticity of VPS10P domain receptor expression in the healthy brain and in response to injury.</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Comprehensive Topographical Map of the Serotonergic Fibers in the Male Mouse Brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5429e386-88fd-405e-aafa-ab1607c8fe8f/cne25027-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive look at the whole brain serotonergic projection using the SERT‐EGFP transgenic mice. The area specific pattern and rostro‐caudal change from the raphe nuclei in brainstem were mapped.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well established that serotonergic fibers distribute throughout the brain. Abnormal densities or patterns of serotonergic fibers have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Although many classical studies have examined the distribution pattern of serotonergic fibers, most of them were either limited to specific brain areas or had limitations in demonstrating the fine axonal morphology. In this study, we utilize male mice expressing GFP under the SERT promoter to map the topography of serotonergic fibers across the rostro‐caudal extent of each brain area. We demonstrate previously unreported regional density and fine‐grained anatomy of serotonergic fibers. Our findings include: 1) SERT fibers distribute abundantly in the thalamic nuclei close to the midline and dorsolateral areas, in most of the hypothalamic nuclei with few exceptions such as the median eminence and arcuate nuclei, and within the basal amygdaloid complex and lateral septal nuclei, 2) the source fibers of innervation of the hippocampus traverse through the septal nuclei before reaching its destination, 3) unique, filamentous type of straight terminal fibers within the nucleus accumbens, 4) laminar pattern of innervation in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb and cortex with heterogenicity in innervation density among the layers, 5) cortical labelling density gradually decreases rostro‐caudally, 6) fibers traverse and distribute mostly within the gray matter, leaving the white fiber bundles uninnervated, and 7) most of the highly labelled nuclei and cortical areas have predominant anatomical connection to limbic structures. In conclusion, we provide novel, regionally specific insights on the distribution map of serotonergic fibers using transgenic mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Variation of pro‐vasopressin processing in parvocellular and magnocellular neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus: Evidence from the vasopressin‐related glycopeptide copeptin</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Variation of pro‐vasopressin processing in parvocellular and magnocellular neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus: Evidence from the vasopressin‐related glycopeptide copeptin&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/acc92974-608d-413f-849b-984233350acb/cne25026-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neuropeptide produced in multiple nuclei including the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The &lt;i&gt;AVP&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes prepro‐AVP that comprise the signal peptide, AVP, neurophysin (NPII), and the related glycopeptide copeptin. Here, we report not only that there are species differences between rodents and primates in the processing of the pro‐AVP precursor and production of free copeptin, but also that the processing may not be the same in different groups of pro‐AVP‐expressing cells within a given species.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is synthesized in parvocellular‐ and magnocellular neuroendocrine neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Whereas magnocellular AVP neurons project primarily to the posterior pituitary, parvocellular AVP neurons project to the median eminence and to extrahypothalamic areas. The &lt;i&gt;AVP&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes pre‐provasopressin that comprises the signal peptide, AVP, neurophysin (NPII), and a copeptin glycopeptide. In the present study, we used an N‐terminal copeptin antiserum to examine copeptin expression in magno‐ and parvocellular neurons in the hypothalamus in the mouse, rat, and macaque monkey. Although magnocellular NPII‐expressing neurons exhibited strong N‐terminal copeptin immunoreactivity in all three species, most parvocellular neurons that expressed NPII were devoid of copeptin immunoreactivity in mouse (~90%) and in rat (~53%), whereas in monkey hypothalamus, all NPII‐immunoreactive parvocellular neurons contained strong copeptin immunoreactivity. Immunoelectron microscopy in the mouse clearly showed copeptin‐immunoreactivity co‐localized with NPII‐immunoreactivity in neurosecretory vesicles in the internal median eminence and posterior pituitary, but not in the external median eminence. Intracerebroventricular administration of a prohormone convertase inhibitor, hexa‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐arginine amide (D6R) resulted in a marked reduction of copeptin‐immunoreactivity in the NPII‐immunoreactive magnocellular PVN neurons in the mouse, suggesting that low protease activity and incomplete processing of pro‐vasopressin could explain the disproportionally low levels of N‐terminal copeptin expression in rodent AVP (NPII)‐expressing parvocellular neurons. Current use of the assay of copeptin as a surrogate for vasopressin means that physiologic and phylogenetic aspects of copeptin expression among neuroendocrine neurons require further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Protection of MCC950 against Alzheimer's disease via inhibiting neuronal pyroptosis in SAMP8 mice</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neuronal dysfunction and loss are thought to be one of the causes of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the specific mechanism of neuronal loss in the pathogenesis of AD remains controversial. This study explored the role of NLRP3 inflammasome-induced neuronal pyroptosis in neuronal loss of AD, and pioneered the use of NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 to intervene in the treatment of senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. In vitro, human primary neurons (HPNs) pretreated with MCC950 were stimulated with amyloid-β&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; (Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;), and it was found that MCC950 significantly reduced the neurotoxicity of Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; by inhibiting neuronal pyroptosis. In vivo, SAMP8 mice were randomly divided into vehicle-treated group and MCC950-treated group, and it was found that MCC950 also played a positive role in treatment. The intervention of MCC950 improved the spatial memory ability and brain histological morphology of SAMP8 mice, and reduced the deposition of amyloid-β in the brain. Furthermore, MCC950 was found to inhibit the overexpressions of NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD, which were the response factors of pyroptosis in SAMP8 mouse neurons, by immunofluorescence staining. In this study, we found that neuronal pyroptosis induced by the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD axis was an important factor in neuronal loss of AD, and revealed that MCC950 might be a potential AD therapeutic agent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Hennighausen and Lee find that increased expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor Ace2 in mammary tissue of mice during pregnancy and lactation is controlled through the hormone-activated JAK/STAT5 signaling pathway. Their findings suggest the possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through breast milk and non-pulmonary tissue damage.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Phase precession in the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex</title>

	<description>Knowing where we are, where we have been, and where we are going is critical to many behaviors, including navigation and memory. One potential neuronal mechanism underlying this ability is phase precession, in which spatially tuned neurons represent sequences of positions by activating at progressively earlier phases of local network theta (~5-10~Hz) oscillations. Phase precession may be a general neural pattern for representing sequential events for learning and memory. However, phase precession has never been observed in humans. By recording human single-neuron activity during spatial navigation, we show that spatially tuned neurons in the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex exhibit phase precession. Furthermore, beyond the neural representation of locations, we show evidence for phase precession related to specific goal-states. Our findings thus extend theta phase precession to humans and suggest that this phenomenon has a broad functional role for the neural representation of both spatial and non-spatial information.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Alfaxalone activates Human Pregnane-X Receptors with greater efficacy than Allopregnanolone: an in-vitro study with implications for neuroprotection during anesthesia.</title>

	<description>Abstract Background Alfaxalone is a fast acting intravenous anesthetic with high therapeutic index. It is an analogue of the naturally occurring neurosteroid, allopregnanolone which has been implicated in causing neuroprotection, neurogenesis and preservation of cognition, through activation of pregnane X receptors in the central nervous system. This study investigated whether alfaxalone can activate human pregnane X receptors (hPXR) as effectively as allopregnanolone. Methods Allopregnanolone and alfaxalone were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to make allopregnanolone and alfaxalone treatment solutions (serial 3 fold dilution concentration range, 50,000 to 206 nM). Activation of hPXR by these ligand solutions compared with vehicle control was measured by an in vitro method using human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) expressing hPXR hybridised and linked to the firefly luciferase gene. Ligand binding with and activation of hPXR in those cells caused downstream changes in luciferase activity and light emission. That activity was measured as relative light units using a plate reading luminometer, thus quantifying the changes in hPXR activity caused by the ligand applied to the HEK293 cells. Ligand log concentration response curves were constructed to compare efficacy and potency of allopregnanolone and alfaxalone. Results Allopregnanolone and alfaxalone both activated the hPXR to cause dose related light emission by the linked firefly luciferase. Control solutions (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) produced low level light emissions. Equimolar concentrations of alfaxalone were more efficacious in activation of hPXR: 50,000 nM, p = 0.0019; 16,700 nM, p = 0.0472; 5,600 nM, p = 0.0031 [Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA]. Conclusions Alfaxalone activates human-pregnane X receptors with greater efficacy compared with the endogenous ligand allopregnanolone. These results suggest that alfaxalone sedation and anesthesia may be accompanied by beneficial effects normally caused by the physiological effects of allopregnanolone, namely neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and preservation of cognition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Electrophysiological Indicators of Sleep-associated Memory Consolidation in 5- to 6-year-old Children</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.04.283606v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>In young adults, memory consolidation during sleep is supported by a time-coordinated interplay of sleep spindles and slow oscillations. However, given tremendous developmental changes in sleep spindle and slow oscillation morphology, it remains elusive whether the same mechanisms as identified in young adults are comparably functional across childhood. Here, we characterise slow and fast sleep spindles and their temporal coupling to slow oscillations in 24 pre-school children. Further, we ask whether slow and fast sleep spindles and their modulation during slow oscillations are similarly associated with behavioural indicators of declarative memory consolidation as suggested from adult literature. Employing a development-sensitive, individualised approach, we reliably identify an inherent, development-specific fast sleep spindle type, though nested in the adult-like slow sleep spindle frequency range, along with a dominant slow sleep spindle type. Further, we provide evidence for the modulation of fast sleep spindles during slow oscillations, already in pre-school children. However, the temporal coordination between fast sleep spindles and slow oscillations is weaker and less precise than expected from adult research. While we do not find evidence for a critical contribution of the pattern of fast sleep spindle modulation during slow oscillations for memory consolidation, crucially, both inherent slow and fast sleep spindles separately are differentially related to sleep-associated consolidation of items of varying quality. While a higher number of slow sleep spindles is associated with stronger maintenance of medium-quality memories, more fast sleep spindles are linked to higher gain of low-quality items. Our results provide evidence for two functionally relevant inherent sleep spindle types in pre-school children despite not fully matured sleep spindle - slow oscillation coupling.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Relationship between Regional White Matter Hyperintensities and Alpha Oscillations in Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.04.283200v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.04.283200v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Objective: To investigate whether regional white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) relate to alpha oscillations (AO) in a large population-based sample of elderly individuals. Methods: We associated voxel-wise WMHs from high-resolution 3-Tesla MRI with neuronal alpha oscillations (AO) from resting-state multichannel EEG at sensor (N=907) and source space (N=855) in older participants of the LIFE-Adult study (60-80 years). In EEG, we computed relative alpha power (AP), individual alpha peak frequency (IAPF), as well as long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) that represent dynamic properties of the signal. We implemented whole-brain voxel-wise regression models to identify regions where parameters of AO were linked to probability of WMH occurrence. We further used mediation analyses to examine whether WMH volume mediated the relationship between age and AO. Results: Higher prevalence of WMHs in the superior and posterior corona radiata was related to elevated relative AP, with strongest correlations in the bilateral occipital cortex, even after controlling for potential confounding factors. The age-related increase of relative AP in the right temporal brain region was shown to be mediated by total WMH volume. Conclusion: A high relative AP corresponding to increased regional WMHs was not associated with age per se, in fact, this relationship was mediated by WMHs. We argue that the WMH-associated increase of AP reflects a generalized and likely compensatory spread of AO leading to a larger number of synchronously recruited neurons. Our findings thus suggest that longitudinal EEG recordings might be sensitive to detect functional changes due to WMHs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Frontotemporal dementia mutant tau (P301L) locks Fyn in an open, active conformation conducive to nanoclustering</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.04.282855v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Fyn is a Src kinase that controls critical signalling cascades and its postsynaptic enrichment underpins synaptotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTLD-tau). Previously, we found that pathogenic FTLD tau mutant (P301L) expression promotes aberrant trapping of Fyn in nanoclusters within hippocampal dendrites via an unknown mechanism (Padmanabhan et al., 2019). Here, we imaged Fyn-mEos2 using single particle tracking photoactivated localization microscopy (sptPALM) to demonstrate that nanoclustering of Fyn in hippocampal dendrites is promoted by Fyn's open, primed conformation. Disrupting the auto-inhibitory, closed conformation of Fyn through phospho-inhibition, and perturbation of Fyn's SH3 domain increases, Fyn's nanoscale trapping. However, inhibition of Fyn's catalytic domain has no impact on its mobility. Tau-P301L promotes Fyn lateral trapping via Fyn opening and ensuing increased catalytic activation. Pathogenic tau may therefore drive synaptotoxicity by locking Fyn in an open, catalytically active conformation, leading to postsynaptic entrapment and aberrant signalling cascades.</description>

	<description>Melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) are intrinsically photosensitive photoreceptors contributing to visual and non-image-forming functions of the eye. Isolating mRGC roles in humans is challenging, therefore mRGCs functions remains to be fully characterized. We explored mRGCs contribution to light-driven visual and cognitive brain responses in Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), given mRGC relative sparing in LHON. Twelve patients and twelve matched healthy controls (HC) participated in an fMRI protocol including visual and visual cognitive paradigms under blue (480nm) and red light (620nm). Higher occipital activation was found in response to sustained blue vs. red stimulation in LHON vs. HC. Similarly, brain responses to the executive task were larger under blue vs. red light in LHON over lateral prefrontal cortex. These findings are in line with LHON mRGCs relative sparing and support mRGCs contribution to non-visual and visual functions in humans, with potential implication for visual rehabilitation in optic neuropathy patients.</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mutations in the synaptic nuclear envelope protein 1 (SYNE1) gene have been reported to cause autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA) type 1 with highly variable clinical phenotypes. The aim of this study was to describe the phenotypic-genetic spectrum of SYNE1-related ARCA1 patients in the Chinese population. We screened 158 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive or sporadic ataxia for variants in SYNE1 using next-generation sequencing. Pathogenicity assessment of SYNE1 variants was interpreted according to the American College of Medical Genetics standards and guidelines. We identified eight truncating variants and two missense variants spreading throughout the SYNE1 gene from six unrelated families, including nine novel variants and one reported variant. Of the six index patients, two patients showed the classical pure cerebellar ataxia, while four patients exhibited non-cerebellar phenotypes, including motor neuron symptoms, cognitive impairment, or mental retardation. The variants associated with motor neuron or cognition involvement tend to be located in the C-terminal region of SYNE1 protein, compared with the variants related to pure cerebellar ataxia. Our data indicating SYNE1 mutation is one of the more common causes of recessive ataxia in the Chinese population. The use of next-generation sequencing has enabled the rapid analysis of recessive ataxia and further expanded our understanding of genotype-phenotype correlation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Progressive Ataxia with Hemiplegic Migraines: a Phenotype of CACNA1A Missense Mutations, Not CAG Repeat Expansions</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We report a 52-year-old woman presenting with autosomal dominant progressive cerebellar ataxia and familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 whose genetic evaluation, negative for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, and 6, revealed instead a heterozygous pathogenic missense mutation in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CACNA1A&lt;/em&gt; (NM_001127221:c.1748G &amp;gt; A:p.Arg583Gln). A systematic literature review showed that Arg583Gln is associated predominantly with progressive ataxia combined with episodic disorders (overwhelmingly hemiplegic migraine) whereas Thr666Met, the other most common &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CACNA1A&lt;/em&gt; missense mutation, with a combination of progressive ataxia and episodic disorders in half the cases and episodic disorders only in the other half. While uncertainties remain in the genotype-phenotype correlation of all &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CACNA1A&lt;/em&gt; mutations, the accumulated evidence suggests that that the co-occurrence of hemiplegic migraine and autosomal dominant progressive cerebellar ataxia should guide the clinician to test for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CACNA1A&lt;/em&gt; missense mutation rather than CAG expansions or truncating mutations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Exendin-4 Reversed the PC12 Cell Damage Induced by circRNA CDR1as/miR-671/GSK3β Signaling Pathway</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of circRNA cerebellar degeneration–related protein 1 antisense RNA(CDR1as)/miR-671/GSK3β signaling pathway on PC12 cell injury and the mechanism of Exendin-4 (Ex-4) in PC12 cell injury protection. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression levels of circular RNA CDR1as and miR-671 in PC12 cells. By overexpressing or knocking out CDR1as, miR-671, and GSK3β, the role of CDR1as, miR-671, and GSK3β in PC12 cell injury was analyzed. The binding of CDR1as to miR-671 and GSK3β to miR-671 was verified by dual luciferase reporter assay. PC12 cells were treated with 1-methyl-4 phenyl-pyridine ion (MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to construct a PC12 cell damage model. PC12 cell transfection experiments were used to confirm the role of CDR1as/miR-671/GSK3β signal axis in PC12 cell damage, and the role of Ex-4 in the association of circRNA CDR1as/miR-671/GSK3β signaling axis and PC12 cell damage. PC12 cell damage was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and cellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Ex-4 reversed the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and GSK-3β in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-treated PC12 cells, and reduced MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced PC12 cell damage. CircRNA CDR1as upregulated the expression of GSK3β by sponge miR-671. Ex-4 downregulated CDR1as expression and upregulated miR-671 expression in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced PC12 cell. Silencing of CDR1as reduced MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced PC12 cell damage. CDR1as transfection downregulated the expression of miR-671 in PC12 cells, promoted the expression and phosphorylated of GSK3β, and induced PC12 cell damage. GSK3β silencing reversed CDR1as-induced PC12 cell damage. CDR1as promoted the phosphorylation level of GSK3β in PC12 cells to cause cell damage; Ex-4 reversed the phosphorylation of GSK3β caused by CDR1as in PC12 cells and reduced the PC12 cell damage caused by CDR1as. Ex-4 reverses the damage of PC12 cells induced by CDR1as/miR-671/GSK3β signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Association Between REELIN Gene Polymorphisms (rs7341475 and rs262355) and Risk of Schizophrenia: an Updated Meta-analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a destructive neuropsychiatric illness affecting millions of people worldwide. The correlation between RELN gene polymorphisms and SCZ was investigated by previous researches, though the results remained conflicting. Based on the available studies, we conducted this meta-analysis to provide a more comprehensive outcome on whether the RELN gene polymorphisms (rs7341475 and rs262355) are associated with SCZ. A total of 15 studies with 25,403 subjects (9047 cases and 16,356 controls) retrieved from PubMed, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, Wiley, BMC, Cochrane, Springer, MDPI, SAGE, and Google Scholar up to June 2020 were included. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. The heterogeneity was checked using &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistics and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;-test, whereas publication bias was also measured. The rs7341475 polymorphism showed a significantly lower risk for SCZ for the allele (A vs. G: OR = 0.93, 95%CI = 0.87–0.99), codominant 1 (AG vs. GG: OR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.85–0.99), dominant model (AA+AG vs. GG: OR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.86–0.98), and over dominant model (AG vs. AA+GG: OR = 0.92, 95%Cl = 0.86–0.99). The allele, codominant model 1, and dominant models remained statistically significant after the correction of the Bonferroni (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.025). Subgroup analysis confirmed the association of allele and dominant models in the Caucasian after Bonferroni correction. For rs262355 polymorphism, a significantly increased risk of SCZ was found only in Caucasians for codominant 2, dominant, and allele models, but significance exists only for the allele model after Bonferroni correction. Publication bias was found in the case of codominant 2 and recessive models for rs7341475 in the overall population, but this publication was not found after performing the Bonferroni correction or after performing the subgroup analysis. No such publication was found for rs262355. The results suggest that RELN rs7341475 is associated with a lower risk of SCZ in the overall population and Caucasian population, but rs262355 is associated with an increased risk of SCZ only in the Caucasian population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The existence of electrical communication among pyramidal cells (PCs) in the adult cortex has been debated by neuroscientists for several decades. Gap junctions (GJs) among cortical interneurons have been well documented experimentally and their functional roles have been proposed by both computational neuroscientists and experimentalists alike. Experimental evidence for similar junctions among pyramidal cells in the cortex, however, has remained elusive due to the apparent rarity of these couplings among neurons. In this work, we develop a neuronal network model that includes observed probabilities and strengths of electrotonic coupling between PCs and gap-junction coupling among interneurons, in addition to realistic synaptic connectivity among both populations. We use this network model to investigate the effect of electrotonic coupling between PCs on network behavior with the goal of theoretically addressing this controversy of existence and purpose of electrotonically coupled PCs in the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The semicircular ducts (SCDs) of the vestibular system play an instrumental role in equilibration and rotation perception of vertebrates. The present paper is a review of quantitative approaches and shows how SCDs function. It consists of three parts. First, the biophysical mechanisms of an SCD system composed of three mutually connected ducts, allowing endolymph to flow from one duct into another one, are analysed. The flow is quantified by solving the continuity equations in conjunction with the equations of motion of the SCD hydrodynamics. This leads to mathematical expressions that are suitable for further analytical and numerical analysis. Second, analytical solutions are derived through four simplifying steps while keeping the essentials of the coupled system intact. Some examples of flow distributions for different rotations are given. Third, the focus is on the transducer function of the SCDs. The complex structure of the mechano-electrical transduction apparatus inside the ampullae is described, and the consequences for sensitivity and frequency response are evaluated. Furthermore, both the contributions of the different terms of the equations of motion and the influence of Brownian motion are analysed. Finally, size limitations, allometry and evolutionary aspects are taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Behavioral strategies that depend on sensory information are not immutable; rather they can be shaped by the specific sensory context in which animals develop. This behavioral plasticity depends on the remarkable capacity for the brain to reorganize in response to alterations in the sensory environment, particularly when changes in sensory input occur at an early age. To study this phenomenon, we utilize the short-tailed opossum, a marsupial that has been a valuable animal model to study developmental plasticity due to the extremely immature state of its nervous system at birth. Previous studies in opossums have demonstrated that removal of retinal inputs early in development results in profound alterations to cortical connectivity and functional organization of visual and somatosensory cortex; however, behavioral consequences of this plasticity are not well understood. We trained early blind (EB) and sighted control (SC) opossums to perform a two-alternative forced choice texture discrimination task. Whisker trimming caused an acute deficit in discrimination accuracy for both EB and SC animals indicating that they primarily used a whisker-based strategy to guide choices based on tactile cues - though performance recovered in days, suggesting a shift to the use of other body parts when whiskers were absent. Mystacial whiskers were important for performance in both groups; however, genal whiskers only contributed to performance in EB animals. EB opossums significantly outperformed SC opossums in discrimination accuracy, being more sensitive to textural differences by ~75 m smaller. Our results support behavioral compensation following early blindness using tactile inputs, especially the whisker system.</description>

	<description>Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) improves life expectancy and lowers the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) opportunistic infections, lymphomas, and HIV-associated dementia in HIV+ people. However, mild-to-moderate HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in about 50% of HIV+ people, even when HIV replication is well controlled. In vitro, animal model, and clinical studies suggest that cART neurotoxicity could be a contributing factor to the progression of HAND. In this study, we developed two in vitro model systems using glutamatergic neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-Gluts) and fetal neural precursor cells (hNPCs) to assay for antiretroviral (ARV) effects on mature and developing neurons, respectively. We tested four ARVs: the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors tenofovir disproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) and the integrase inhibitors dolutegravir (DTG) and elvitegravir (EVG). DTG, EVG, and TDF decreased hiPSC-Glut viability and neurite length; all four antiretrovirals decreased hiPSC-Glut synapse counts; and DTG and EVG decreased the frequency and magnitude of hiPSC-Glut calcium transients. The magnitude of these neurotoxic effects increased with longer ARV exposure times and with the exposure of hiPSC-Gluts to two or three ARVs simultaneously. These results suggest that certain ARVs could cause HAND by decreasing the survival and function of CNS neurons. In fetal hNPCs, TDF decreased viability and changed the distribution of epigenetic histone modifications, suggesting that this ARV may alter neurogenesis, which could impair cognition in adults and/or CNS development for those exposed to ARV in utero or early childhood. Our study establishes human preclinical neurotoxicity systems that can screen for potential ARV CNS toxicity and develop safer cART regimens.</description>

	<description>Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is primarily caused by traumatic social events and is characterized by intense fear and avoidance of socially enriched contexts. Formation of such intense social aversion requires learning of the association between trauma and originally neutral social stimuli. Acetylation of histones in response to learning is critical for long-term memory formation. Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) have emerged as powerful negative regulators of long-term memory formation. However, the lack of clarity in isoform and spatial specificity in HDAC function exists. Utilizing the social fear conditioning (SFC) as well as cued fear conditioning (CFC) paradigms, we aimed to functionally characterize the role of class I HDACs, especially HDAC1, in the regulation of aversive memories in social versus non-social contexts. Using cFos expression as a marker of cellular activity, we revealed that the lateral septum (LS) was specifically activated post-acquisition in socially fear conditioned (SFC+) mice. We further measured an increase in activity-inducing HDAC1 phosphorylation at serine residues within the septum of SFC+ mice during extinction of social fear. Pharmacological inhibition of HDAC1 within the LS facilitated, while viral overexpression of septal HDAC1 impaired extinction of social fear. Finally, we found that the abovementioned facilitation of extinction memory by HDAC1 inhibition was long-lasting and persists even after 30 days of extinction. Our results show that LS-HDAC1 is a key regulator of long-lasting social fear extinction, which points towards HDAC1 as a potential therapeutic target for SAD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Structural and Functional Brain-wide Alterations in A350V IQSEC2 Mutant Mice Displaying Autistic-like Behavior</title>

	<description>IQSEC2 is an X-linked gene which is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability and epilepsy. IQSEC2 is a postsynaptic density protein, localized on excitatory synapses as part of the NMDA receptor complex and is suggested to play a role in AMPA receptor trafficking and mediation of long-term depression. Here, we present brain-wide structural volumetric and functional connectivity characterization in a novel mouse model with a missense mutation in the IQ domain of IQSEC2 (A350V). Using high-resolution structural and functional MRI, we show that animals with the A350V mutation display increased whole-brain volume which was further found to be specific to the cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, using a data-driven approach we demonstrate that A350V mice present alterations in structure-function relations of the frontal, auditory, and visual networks. Examination of these alterations revealed an increase in functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsomedial striatum. We also show that corticostriatal functional connectivity is correlated with individual variability in social behavior only in A350V mice, as assessed using the three-chamber social preference test. Our results at the systems-level bridge the impact of previously reported changes in AMPA receptor trafficking to network-level disruption and impaired social behavior. Further, the A350V mouse model recapitulates similarly reported brain-wide changes in other ASD mouse models, with substantially different cellular-level pathologies that nonetheless result in similar brain-wide alterations, suggesting that novel therapeutic approaches in ASD that result in systems-level rescue will be relevant to IQSEC2 mutations.</description>

	<description>Injured axons must regenerate to restore nervous system function, and regeneration is regulated in part by external factors from non-neuronal tissues. Many of these extrinsic factors act in the immediate cellular environment of the axon to promote or restrict regeneration, but the existence of long-distance signals regulating axon regeneration has not been clear. Here we show that the Rab GTPase rab-27 inhibits regeneration of GABAergic motor neurons in C. elegans through activity in the intestine. Re-expression of RAB-27, but not the closely related RAB-3, in the intestine of rab-27 mutant animals is sufficient to rescue normal regeneration. Several additional components of an intestinal neuropeptide secretion pathway also inhibit axon regeneration, including NPDC1/cab-1, SNAP25/aex-4, and KPC3/aex-5. Together these data indicate that RAB-27-dependent neuropeptide secretion from the intestine inhibits axon regeneration, and point to distal tissues as potent extrinsic regulators of regeneration.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: TRPV1 feed-forward sensitisation depends on COX2 upregulation in primary sensory neurons</title>

	<description>Increased activity and excitability (sensitisation) of a series of molecules including the transient receptor potential ion channel, vanilloid subfamily, member 1 (TRPV1) in pain-sensing (nociceptive) primary sensory neurons are pivotal for developing pathological pain experiences in tissue injuries. TRPV1 sensitisation is induced and maintained by two major mechanisms; post-translational and transcriptional changes in TRPV1 induced by inflammatory mediators produced and accumulated in injured tissues, and TRPV1 activation-induced feed-forward signalling. The latter mechanism includes synthesis of TRPV1 agonists within minutes, and upregulation of various receptors functionally linked to TRPV1 within a few hours, in nociceptive primary sensory neurons. Here, we report that a novel mechanism, which contributes to TRPV1 activation-induced TRPV1-sensitisation within ~30 minutes in at least ~30% of TRPV1-expressing cultured murine primary sensory neurons, is mediated through upregulation in cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) expression and increased synthesis of a series of COX2 products. These findings highlight the importance of feed-forward signalling in sensitisation, and the value of inhibiting COX2 activity to control pain, in nociceptive primary sensory neurons in tissue injuries.</description>

	<description>The mammalian brain's navigation system is informed in large part by visual signals. While the primary visual cortex (V1) is extensively interconnected with brain areas involved in computing head direction (HD) information, it is unknown to what extent navigation information is available in the population activity of visual cortex. To test whether information about head direction information is available in visual cortex, we recorded neuronal activity in V1 of freely behaving rats. We show that significant information about yaw, roll, and pitch of the head can be linearly decoded from V1 either in the presence or absence of visual cues. Individual V1 neurons were tuned to head direction, with a quarter of the neurons tuned to conjunctions of angles in all three planes. These results demonstrate the presence of a critical navigational signal in a primary cortical sensory area and support predictive coding theories of brain function.</description>

	<description>Purpose: Letter resolution depends on three factors: perceivability, response bias, and similarity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of response bias (the sensory-independent factor) on resolution thresholds of Sloan letters in central and paracentral vision. Methods: Nine subjects with normal ocular health were recruited for this study. Using the method of constant stimuli, individual Sloan letters resolution thresholds were measured at 0{degrees} (central) and at {+/-}3{degrees} eccentricity along the vertical meridian of the visual field. Response biases and letter similarities were computed using Luce's choice model. Results: Results showed that the differences in resolution thresholds of individual Sloan letters were significant at the central (F (9, 80) =5.02, p&amp;lt;.001), the upper (X2 (9) = 50.38, p&amp;lt;.05) and the lower (X2 (9) = 56.32, p&amp;lt;.05) visual field locations. Unlike letter similarity measures, response biases showed significant correlations to the differences in thresholds at the central (r = -0.83, p&amp;lt;.05), the upper (r = -0.73, p&amp;lt;.05) and the lower (r = -0.70, p&amp;lt;.05) visual field locations. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that response biases have a significant effect on resolution of Sloan letters that could result in overestimating resolution acuity in central and paracentral visual field locations.</description>

	<description>Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique capable of altering cortical activity, has been proposed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio at the neuronal level and the sensitivity of the neurons following an inverted U-function. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of tRNS on vGLUT1 and GAD 65-67 and its safety in terms of pathological changes. For that, juvenile mice were randomly distributed in three different groups: tRNS 1x receiving tRNS at the density current used in humans (0.3 A/m2, 20 min), tRNS 100x receiving tRNS at two orders of magnitude higher (30.0 A/m2, 20 min) and sham (0.3 A/m2, 15 s). Nine tRNS sessions during five weeks were administered to the prefrontal cortex of alert animals. No detectable tissue macroscopic lesions were observed after tRNS sessions. Post-stimulation immunohistochemical analysis of GAD 65-67 and vGLUT1 immunoreactivity showed a reduced GAD 65-67 immunoreactivity levels in the region directly beneath the electrode for tRNS 1x group with no significant effects in the tRNS 100x nor sham group. The observed results points to an excitatory effect associated with a decrease in GABA levels in absence of major histopathological alterations providing a novel mechanistic explanation for tRNS effects.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Relations between large-scale brain connectivity and effects of regional stimulation depend on collective dynamical state</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lia Papadopoulos, Christopher W. Lynn, Demian Battaglia, Danielle S. Bassett&lt;/p&gt;

At the macroscale, the brain operates as a network of interconnected neuronal populations, which display coordinated rhythmic dynamics that support interareal communication. Understanding how stimulation of different brain areas impacts such activity is important for gaining basic insights into brain function and for further developing therapeutic neurmodulation. However, the complexity of brain structure and dynamics hinders predictions regarding the downstream effects of focal stimulation. More specifically, little is known about how the collective oscillatory regime of brain network activity—in concert with network structure—affects the outcomes of perturbations. Here, we combine human connectome data and biophysical modeling to begin filling these gaps. By tuning parameters that control collective system dynamics, we identify distinct states of simulated brain activity and investigate how the distributed effects of stimulation manifest at different dynamical working points. When baseline oscillations are weak, the stimulated area exhibits enhanced power and frequency, and due to network interactions, activity in this excited frequency band propagates to nearby regions. Notably, beyond these linear effects, we further find that focal stimulation causes more distributed modifications to interareal coherence in a band containing regions’ baseline oscillation frequencies. Importantly, depending on the dynamical state of the system, these broadband effects can be better predicted by functional rather than structural connectivity, emphasizing a complex interplay between anatomical organization, dynamics, and response to perturbation. In contrast, when the network operates in a regime of strong regional oscillations, stimulation causes only slight shifts in power and frequency, and structural connectivity becomes most predictive of stimulation-induced changes in network activity patterns. In sum, this work builds upon and extends previous computational studies investigating the impacts of stimulation, and underscores the fact that both the stimulation site, and, crucially, the regime of brain network dynamics, can influence the network-wide responses to local perturbations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uAVtzrkU2EE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Microbial dysbiosis in the upper digestive tract is linked to an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Overabundance of &lt;i&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; is associated with shorter survival of ESCC patients. We investigated the molecular mechanisms driving aggressive progression of ESCC by &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt;. Intracellular invasion of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; potentiated proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis abilities of ESCC cells via transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-dependent &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; mothers against decapentaplegic homologs (Smads)/Yes-associated protein (YAP)/Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) activation. Smads/YAP/TAZ/TEA domain transcription factor1 (TEAD1) complex formation was essential to initiate downstream target gene expression, inducing an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness features. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; augmented secretion and bioactivity of TGFβ through glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP) up-regulation. Accordingly, disruption of either the GARP/TGFβ axis or its activated Smads/YAP/TAZ complex abrogated the tumor-promoting role of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; signature genes based on its activated effector molecules can efficiently distinguish ESCC patients into low- and high-risk groups. Targeting &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gingivalis&lt;/i&gt; or its activated effectors may provide novel insights into clinical management of ESCC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/D7-8ixyJAjk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Isolation of antigen-specific, disulphide-rich knob domain peptides from bovine antibodies</title>

As a novel alternative to established surface display or combinatorial chemistry approaches for the discovery of therapeutic peptides, we present a method for the isolation of small, cysteine-rich domains from bovine antibody ultralong complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). We show for the first time that isolated bovine antibody knob domains can function as autonomous entities by binding antigen outside the confines of the antibody scaffold. This yields antibody fragments so small as to be considered peptides, each stabilised by an intricate, bespoke arrangement of disulphide bonds. For drug discovery, cow immunisations harness the immune system to generate knob domains with affinities in the picomolar to low nanomolar range, orders of magnitude higher than unoptimized peptides from naïve library screening. Using this approach, knob domain peptides that tightly bound Complement component C5 were obtained, at scale, using conventional antibody discovery and peptide purification techniques.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SDm1YrOZ8ss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The key driver of breathing rhythm is the preBotzinger Complex (preBotC) whose activity is modulated by various categorical inputs, e.g., volitional, physiological, emotional. While the preBötC is highly interconnected with other regions of the breathing central pattern generator (bCPG) in the brainstem, there is no data about the direct projections to either excitatory and inhibitory preBotC subpopulations from other elements of bCPG or from suprapontine regions. Using modified rabies tracing, we identified neurons throughout the brain that send monosynaptic projections to identified excitatory and inhibitory preBötC neurons. Within the brainstem, neurons from sites in the bCPG, including the contralateral preBötC, Bötzinger Complex (BötC), the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), parafacial region (pFL/pFV or RTN/pFRG), parabrachial nuclei, send direct projections to both excitatory and inhibitory preBotC neurons. Suprapontine inputs to the excitatory and inhibitory preBötC neurons include the superior colliculus, red nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and cortex; these projections represent potential direct pathways for volitional, emotional, and physiological control of breathing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Implantable Cardiac Monitoring in the Secondary Prevention of Cryptogenic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25886?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25886?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we sought to evaluate the impact of implantable cardiac monitoring (ICM) in the prevention of stroke recurrence after a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated consecutive patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA admitted in a comprehensive stroke center during an 8‐year period. We compared the baseline characteristics and outcomes between patients receiving conventional cardiac monitoring with repeated 24‐hour Holter‐monitoring during the first 5 years in the outpatient setting and those receiving continuous cardiac monitoring with ICM during the last 3 years. Associations on the outcomes of interest were further assessed in multivariable regression models adjusting for potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 373 patients receiving conventional cardiac monitoring and 123 patients receiving ICM. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) detection was higher in the ICM cohort compared to the conventional cardiac monitoring cohort (21.1% vs 7.5%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). ICM was independently associated with an increased likelihood of PAF detection during follow‐up (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16–3.24) in multivariable analyses. Patients receiving ICM were also found to have significantly higher rates of anticoagulation initiation (18.7% vs 6.4%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and lower risk of stroke recurrence (4.1% vs 11.8%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013). ICM was independently associated with a lower risk of stroke recurrence during follow‐up (HR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.11–0.90) in multivariable analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICM appears to be independently associated with a higher likelihood of PAF detection and anticoagulation initiation after a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA. ICM was also independently related to lower risk of stroke recurrence in our cryptogenic stroke / TIA cohort. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alertness Training Improves Spatial Bias and Functional Ability in Spatial Neglect</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25862?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25862?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a multisite, randomized, double‐blinded, controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a digital health intervention targeting the intrinsic regulation of goal‐directed alertness in patients with chronic hemispatial neglect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty‐nine participants with hemispatial neglect, who demonstrated significant spatially biased attention after acquired brain injury, were randomly assigned to the experimental attention remediation treatment or the active control group. The participants engaged with the remotely administered interventions for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was spatial bias on the Posner cueing task (response time difference: left minus right target trials). Secondary outcomes included functional abilities (measured via the Catherine Bergego scale and Barthel index), spatial cognition, executive function, quality of life, and sleep. Assessments were conducted before and immediately after participation in the experimental intervention or control condition, and again after a 3‐month no‐contact period.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with the active control group, the intervention group exhibited a significant improvement in the primary outcome, a reduction in spatially biased attention on the Posner cueing task (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010, Cohen's &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.96), in addition to significant improvements in functional abilities as measured on the Catherine Bergego and Barthel indices (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.027, Cohen's &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 0.24).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that our attention training program was effective in improving the debilitating attention deficits common to hemispatial neglect. This benefit generalized to improvements in real‐world functional abilities. This safe, highly scalable, and self‐administered treatment for hemispatial neglect might serve as a useful addition to the existing standard of care. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Training a deep neural network requires a large amount of single-task data
and involves a long time-consuming optimization phase. This is not scalable to
complex, realistic environments with new unexpected changes. Humans can perform
fast incremental learning on the fly and memory systems in the brain play a
critical role. We introduce Sparse Meta Networks -- a meta-learning approach to
learn online sequential adaptation algorithms for deep neural networks, by
using deep neural networks. We augment a deep neural network with a
layer-specific fast-weight memory. The fast-weights are generated sparsely at
each time step and accumulated incrementally through time providing a useful
inductive bias for online continual adaptation. We demonstrate strong
performance on a variety of sequential adaptation scenarios, from a simple
online reinforcement learning to a large scale adaptive language modelling.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01664</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Identifying the optimal design of a new launch vehicle is most important
since design decisions made in the early development phase limit the vehicles'
later performance and determines the associated costs. Reusing the first stage
via retro-propulsive landing increases the complexity even more. Therefore, we
develop an optimization framework for partially reusable launch vehicles, which
enables multidisciplinary design studies. The framework contains suitable mass
estimates of all essential subsystems and a routine to calculate the needed
propellant for the ascent and landing maneuvers. For design optimization, the
framework can be coupled with a genetic algorithm. The overall goal is to
reveal the implications of different propellant combinations and objective
functions on the launcher's optimal design for various mission scenarios. The
results show that the optimization objective influences the most suitable
propellant choice and the overall launcher design, concerning staging, weight,
size, and rocket engine parameters. In terms of gross lift-off weight, liquid
hydrogen seems to be favorable. When optimizing for a minimum structural mass
or an expandable structural mass, hydrocarbon-based solutions show better
results. Finally, launch vehicles using a hydrocarbon fuel in the first stage
and liquid hydrogen in the upper stage are an appealing alternative, combining
both fuels' benefits.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Could radical pairs play a role in xenon-induced general anesthesia?. (arXiv:2009.01661v1 [physics.bio-ph])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the mechanisms underlying anesthesia would be a key step
towards understanding consciousness. The process of xenon-induced general
anesthesia has been shown to involve electron transfer, and the potency of
xenon as a general anesthetic exhibits isotopic dependence. We propose that
these observations can be explained by a mechanism in which the xenon nuclear
spin influences the recombination dynamics of a naturally occurring radical
pair of electrons. We develop a simple model inspired by the body of work on
the radical-pair mechanism in cryptochrome in the context of avian
magnetoreception, and we show that our model can reproduce the observed
isotopic dependence of the general anesthetic potency of xenon in mice. Our
results are consistent with the idea that radical pairs of electrons with
entangled spins could be important for consciousness.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The dominant approach for surface defect detection is the use of hand-crafted
feature-based methods. However, this falls short when conditions vary that
affect extracted images. So, in this paper, we sought to determine how well
several state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks perform in the task of
surface defect detection. Moreover, we propose two methods: CNN-Fusion, that
fuses the prediction of all the networks into a final one, and Auto-Classifier,
which is a novel proposal that improves a Convolutional Neural Network by
modifying its classification component using AutoML. We carried out experiments
to evaluate the proposed methods in the task of surface defect detection using
different datasets from DAGM2007. We show that the use of Convolutional Neural
Networks achieves better results than traditional methods, and also, that
Auto-Classifier out-performs all other methods, by achieving 100% accuracy and
100% AUC results throughout all the datasets.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: End-to-End Learning of Neuromorphic Wireless Systems for Low-Power Edge Artificial Intelligence. (arXiv:2009.01527v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a novel &quot;all-spike&quot; low-power solution for remote
wireless inference that is based on neuromorphic sensing, Impulse Radio (IR),
and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). In the proposed system, event-driven
neuromorphic sensors produce asynchronous time-encoded data streams that are
encoded by an SNN, whose output spiking signals are pulse modulated via IR and
transmitted over general frequence-selective channels; while the receiver's
inputs are obtained via hard detection of the received signals and fed to an
SNN for classification. We introduce an end-to-end training procedure that
treats the cascade of encoder, channel, and decoder as a probabilistic
SNN-based autoencoder that implements Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC). The
proposed system, termed NeuroJSCC, is compared to conventional synchronous
frame-based and uncoded transmissions in terms of latency and accuracy. The
experiments confirm that the proposed end-to-end neuromorphic edge architecture
provides a promising framework for efficient and low-latency remote sensing,
communication, and inference.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In wet-lab experiments \cite{Nakagaki-Yamada-Toth,Tero-Takagi-etal}, the
slime mold Physarum polycephalum has demonstrated its ability to solve shortest
path problems and to design efficient networks, see Figure \ref{Wet-Lab
Experiments} for illustrations. Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold in the
Mycetozoa group. For the shortest path problem, a mathematical model for the
evolution of the slime was proposed in \cite{Tero-Kobayashi-Nakagaki} and its
biological relevance was argued. The model was shown to solve shortest path
problems, first in computer simulations and then by mathematical proof. It was
later shown that the slime mold dynamics can solve more general linear programs
and that many variants of the dynamics have similar convergence behavior. In
this paper, we introduce a dynamics for the network design problem. We
formulate network design as the problem of constructing a network that
efficiently supports a multi-commodity flow problem. We investigate the
dynamics in computer simulations and analytically. The simulations show that
the dynamics is able to construct efficient and elegant networks. In the
theoretical part we show that the dynamics minimizes an objective combining the
cost of the network and the cost of routing the demands through the network. We
also give alternative characterization of the optimum solution.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Exact mean-field theory explains the dual role of electrical synapses in collective synchronization. (arXiv:2009.01445v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical synapses play a major role in setting up neuronal synchronization,
but the precise mechanisms whereby these synapses contribute to synchrony are
subtle and remain elusive. To investigate these mechanisms mean-field theories
for quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons with electrical synapses have been
recently put forward. Still, the validity of these theories is controversial
since they assume that the neurons produce unrealistic, symmetric spikes,
ignoring the well-known impact of spike shape on synchronization. Here we show
that the assumption of symmetric spikes can be relaxed in such theories. The
resulting mean-field equations reveal a dual role of electrical synapses:
First, they equalize membrane potentials favoring the emergence of synchrony.
Second, electrical synapses act as &quot;virtual chemical synapses&quot;, which can be
either excitatory or inhibitory depending upon the spike shape. Our results
offer a precise mathematical explanation of the intricate effect of electrical
synapses in collective synchronization. This reconciles previous theoretical
and numerical works, and confirms the suitability of recent low-dimensional
mean-field theories to investigate electrically coupled neuronal networks.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01269</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Physiological experiments have highlighted how the dendrites of biological
neurons can nonlinearly process distributed synaptic inputs. This is in stark
contrast to units in artificial neural networks that are generally linear apart
from an output nonlinearity. If dendritic trees can be nonlinear, biological
neurons may have far more computational power than their artificial
counterparts. Here we use a simple model where the dendrite is implemented as a
sequence of thresholded linear units. We find that such dendrites can readily
solve machine learning problems, such as MNIST or CIFAR-10, and that they
benefit from having the same input onto several branches of the dendritic tree.
This dendrite model is a special case of sparse network. This work suggests
that popular neuron models may severely underestimate the computational power
enabled by the biological fact of nonlinear dendrites and multiple synapses per
pair of neurons. The next generation of artificial neural networks may
significantly benefit from these biologically inspired dendritic architectures.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Current neural networks are mostly built upon the MP model, which usually
formulates the neuron as executing an activation function on the real-valued
weighted aggregation of signals received from other neurons. In this paper, we
propose the Flexible Transmitter (FT) model, a novel bio-plausible neuron model
with flexible synaptic plasticity. The FT model employs a pair of parameters to
model the transmitters between neurons and puts up a neuron-exclusive variable
to record the regulated neurotrophin density, which leads to the formulation of
the FT model as a two-variable two-valued function, taking the commonly-used MP
neuron model as its special case. This modeling manner makes the FT model not
only biologically more realistic, but also capable of handling complicated
data, even time series. To exhibit its power and potential, we present the
Flexible Transmitter Network (FTNet), which is built on the most common
fully-connected feed-forward architecture taking the FT model as the basic
building block. FTNet allows gradient calculation and can be implemented by an
improved back-propagation algorithm in the complex-valued domain. Experiments
on a board range of tasks show the superiority of the proposed FTNet. This
study provides an alternative basic building block in neural networks and
exhibits the feasibility of developing artificial neural networks with neuronal
plasticity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We give an approximate solution to the difficult inverse problem of inferring
the topology of an unknown network from given time-dependent signals at the
nodes. For example, we measure signals from individual neurons in the brain,
and infer how they are inter-connected. We use Maximum Caliber as an inference
principle. The combinatorial challenge of high-dimensional data is handled
using two different approximations to the pairwise couplings. We show two
proofs of principle: in a nonlinear genetic toggle switch circuit, and in a toy
neural network.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Is Information in the Brain Represented in Continuous or Discrete Form?. (arXiv:1805.01631v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01631</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The question of continuous-versus-discrete information representation in the
brain is a fundamental yet unresolved question. Historically, most analyses
assume a continuous representation without considering the discrete
alternative. Our work explores the plausibility of both, answering the question
from a communications systems engineering perspective. Using Shannon's
communications theory, we posit that information in the brain is represented in
discrete form. We address this hypothesis using 2 approaches. First, we
identify the fundamental communication requirements of the brain. Second, we
estimate the symbol error probability and channel capacity for a continuous
information representation. Our work concludes that information cannot be
communicated and represented reliably in the brain using a continuous
representation - it has to be in a discrete form. This is a major demarcation
from conventional and current wisdom. We apply this discrete result to the 4
major neural coding hypotheses, and illustrate the use of discrete ISI neural
coding in analyzing electrophysiology experimental data. We further posit and
illustrate a plausible direct link between Weber's Law and discrete neural
coding. We end by outlining a number of key research questions on discrete
neural coding.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Estradiol Synthesis Inhibitor Formestane Diminishes the Ability of Sevoflurane to Induce Neurodevelopmental Abnormalities in Male Rats</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;In rodents, the period of increased vulnerability to the developmental effects of general anesthetics coincides with the period of age-specific organizing (masculinizing) effects of the major female sex hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) in the male brain and excitatory GABA type A receptor (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R) signaling. We studied whether E2 synthesis and excitatory GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling are involved in the mediation of the developmental effects of sevoflurane in male rats.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with the inhibitors of E2 synthesis, formestane, or the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-2Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; (NKCC1) Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; importer, bumetanide, prior to sevoflurane exposure for 6 h on postnatal (P) day 4, P5, or P6. We tested whether a subsequent exposure of these rats to sevoflurane on P∼10 would cause electroencephalography (EEG)-detectable seizures. We also evaluated their behavior during the elevated plus maze (EPM) test on P∼60, prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle responses on P∼70, and corticosterone secretion to physical restraint on P∼80.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The rats neonatally exposed to sevoflurane responded to repeated exposure to sevoflurane with increased EEG-detectable seizures (F&lt;sub&gt;(&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.445, P = 0.001) and exhibited deficiencies during the EPM (F&lt;sub&gt;(&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.397, P = 0.008) and PPI (F&lt;sub&gt;(&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;110&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.222, P = 0.003) tests. They also responded to physical restraint with heightened secretion of corticosterone (F&lt;sub&gt;(&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = 11.906, P &amp;lt; 0.001). These parameters in the sevoflurane-exposed rats that were pretreated with formestane or bumetanide were not different from those in the control rats.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results, along with previously published data, suggest that sevoflurane-enhanced E2 synthesis and excitatory GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling at the time of sevoflurane anesthesia are involved in the mediation of the neurodevelopmental effects of the anesthetic in male rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Wnt Signaling Through Nitric Oxide Synthase Promotes the Formation of Multi-Innervated Spines</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.575863</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Structural plasticity of synapses correlates with changes in synaptic strength. Dynamic modifications in dendritic spine number and size are crucial for long-term potentiation (LTP), the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Recent studies have suggested the generation of multi-innervated spines (MIS), in the form of several excitatory presynaptic inputs onto one spine, are crucial for hippocampal memory storage. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying MIS formation and their contribution to LTP. Using 3D enhanced resolution confocal images, we examined the contribution of Wnt synaptic modulators in MIS formation in the context of LTP. We show that blockage of endogenous Wnts with specific Wnt antagonists supresses the formation of MIS upon chemical LTP induction in cultured hippocampal neurons. Gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrate that Wnt7a signaling promotes MIS formation through the postsynaptic Wnt scaffold protein Disheveled 1 (Dvl1) by stimulating neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS). Subsequently, NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) to increase MIS formation. Consistently, we observed an enhanced frequency and amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents. Collectively, our findings identify a unique role for Wnt secreted proteins through nNOS/NO/sGC signaling to modulate MIS formation during LTP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Paternal Deprivation and Female Biparental Family Rearing Induce Dendritic and Synaptic Changes in Octodon degus: I. Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In most mammalian species parent-offspring interactions during early life periods primarily comprise social contacts with the mother, whereas the role of males in parental care is one of the most overlooked and understudied topics. The present study addressed the hypothesis that the complete deprivation of paternal care delays or permanently retards synaptic connectivity in the brain, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the offspring in a sex-specific manner. Another aim of this study was to address the question whether and in which way replacing the father with a female caregiver (in our experiments the “aunt”) can “buffer” the detrimental effects of paternal deprivation on neuronal development. The comparison of: (a) single mother rearing; (b) biparental rearing by father and mother; and (c) biparental rearing by two female caregivers revealed that: (i) paternal care represents a critical environmental factor for synaptic and dendritic development of pyramidal neurons in the vmPFC of their offspring; (ii) a second female caregiver (“aunt”) does not “buffer” the neuronal consequences of paternal deprivation; and that (iii) neuronal development in the vmPFC is differentially affected in male and female offspring in response to different family constellations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Interleukin 4 Affects Epilepsy by Regulating Glial Cells: Potential and Possible Mechanism</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a chronic brain dysfunction induced by an abnormal neuronal discharge that is caused by complicated psychopathologies. Recently, accumulating studies have revealed a close relationship between inflammation and epilepsy. Specifically, microglia and astrocytes are important inflammatory cells in the central nervous system (CNS) that have been proven to be related to the pathogenesis and development of epilepsy. Additionally, interleukin 4 (IL-4) is an anti-inflammatory factor that can regulate microglia and astrocytes in many aspects. This review article focuses on the regulatory role of IL-4 in the pathological changes of glial cells related to epilepsy. We additionally propose that IL-4 may play a protective role in epileptogenesis and suggest that IL-4 may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Prenatal Stress Impairs Postnatal Learning and Memory Development via Disturbance of the cGMP–PKG Pathway and Oxidative Phosphorylation in the Hippocampus of Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00158</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00158</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Clinical and animal studies have found that prenatal stress can lead to pathological changes in embryos and fetuses. However, the mechanisms through which this occurs have not been made clear. In the present study, pregnant rats were subjected to chronic psychological stress during gestational days using an improved communication box system, and the changes in behavioral performance and proteins in the hippocampus of offspring were analyzed. It was found that prenatal stress caused postnatal growth retardation and impairment in spatial learning and memory. Furthermore, in isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation-based proteomics analyses, 158 significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found between the two groups. Further analyses showed that these DEPs are involved in different molecular function categories and participate in several biological processes, such as energy metabolism, learning or memory, and synaptic plasticity. Moreover, the enrichment of pathways showed that the learning and memory impairment was primarily connected with the cyclic guanosine monophosphate–protein kinase G (cGMP–PKG) pathway and oxidative phosphorylation. At the same time, the cGMP level and the expression of PKG protein were significantly decreased, and the neuronal mitochondria appeared to have a swollen and irregular shape in the hippocampus of offspring of stressed rats. These results suggest that the chronic psychological stress that pregnant rats were subjected to during gestational days may have impaired the spatial learning and memory of offspring. This affected the hippocampal oxidative phosphorylation and inhibited the cGMP–PKG pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Social Cognition in Autism Spectrum Disorder Across the Adult Lifespan: Influence of Age and Sex on Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task in a Cross-sectional Sample</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.571408</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.571408</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Approximately 50,000 U.S. teens with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) become adults every year, however little is known regarding how age influences social cognition and if men and women with ASD are differentially impacted across the adult lifespan. Social cognition declines non-linearly with age in neurotypical (NT) adults. Moreover, sex differences have been observed on RME tasks in NT adults but not adults with ASD, although aging effects have been largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This cross-sectional study examined the influence of age and sex on social cognition in adults with ASD compared to NT adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RME) task was administered to evaluate the theory of mind abilities in 95 adults with ASD and 82 NT adults ages 18–71 years. The main effects of diagnosis, age, and sex, as well as two-way and three-way interaction were modeled using linear and quadratic aging terms in a multiple regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A main effect of diagnosis was observed, indicating poorer performance in adults with ASD relative to NT adults. Age and sex interactions were nonsignificant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: We replicated previous findings of reduced theory of mind (ToM) abilities in adults with ASD, compared to NT adults. While interactions were nonsignificant, visual inspection of quadratic age curves indicated the possibility of unique ToM trajectories in men and women with and without ASD that should be investigated in larger longitudinal studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: The Role of Microglial CX3CR1 in Schizophrenia-Related Behaviors Induced by Social Isolation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;According to the microglial hypothesis of schizophrenia, the hyperactivation of microglia and the release of proinflammatory cytokines lead to neuronal loss, which is highly related to the onset of schizophrenia. Recent studies have demonstrated that fractalkine (CX3CL1) and its receptor CX3CR1 modulate the function of microglia. Thus, the present study aimed to determine whether microglial CX3CR1 plays a role in schizophrenia-related behaviors. A classical animal model of schizophrenia, social isolation (from postnatal days 21–56), was used to induce schizophrenia-related behaviors in C57BL/6J and CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice, and the expression of the microglial CX3CR1 protein was examined in several brain areas of the C57BL/6J mice by Western blot analysis. The results revealed that social isolation caused deficits in the prepulse inhibition (PPI) in the C57BL/6J mice but not in the CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice and increased locomotor activity in both the C57BL/6J mice and the CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Moreover, the CX3CR1 protein level was increased in the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus of the isolated C57BL/6J mice. These findings suggested that the function of microglia regulated by CX3CR1 might participate in schizophrenia-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Suppression of spastin Mutant Phenotypes by Pak3 Loss Implicates a Role for Reactive Glia in AD-HSP</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00912</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative mechanisms due to mutations in spastin currently center on neuronal defects, primarily in microtubule and endomembrane regulation. Spastin loss in Drosophila larvae compromises neuronal microtubule distribution, alters synaptic bouton morphology, and weakens synaptic transmission at glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses. Pak3, a p21-activated kinase that promotes actin polymerization and filopodial projections, is required for these spastin mutant defects; animals lacking both genes have normal NMJs. Here we show that Pak3 is expressed in central and peripheral glial populations, and reduction of Pak3 specifically in subperineurial glial cells is sufficient to suppress the phenotypes associated with spastin loss. Subperineurial glia in the periphery ensheathe motor neuron axons and have been shown to extend actin-based projections that regulate synaptic terminals during normal NMJ development. We find that these subperineurial glial projections are Pak3-dependent and nearly twice as frequent in spastin mutants, while in Pak3, spastin double mutants, neither glial projections nor synaptic defects are observed. Spastin deficiency thus increases Pak3-dependent subperineurial glia activity, which is in turn required for neuronal defects. Our results demonstrate a central role for Pak3-mediated, altered glial behavior in the neuronal defects due to spastin loss, and suggest that a similar reactive glia-mediated mechanism may underlie human AD-HSP pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex and serious disease as its multifaceted pathophysiological mechanisms remain vague. The molecular changes of hippocampal and cortical dysfunction in the process of TBI are poorly understood, especially their chronic effects on metabolic profiles. Here we utilize metabolomics-based liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry coupled with bioinformatics method to assess the perturbation of brain metabolism in rat hippocampus and cortex on day 7. The results revealed a signature panel which consisted of 13 identified metabolites to facilitate targeted interventions for subacute TBI discrimination. Purine metabolism change in cortical tissue and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism change in hippocampal tissue were detected. Furthermore, the associations between the metabolite markers and the perturbed pathways were analyzed based on databases: 64 enzyme and one pathway were evolved in TBI. The findings represented significant profiling changes and provided unique metabolite–protein information in a rat model of TBI following the subacute phase. This study may inspire scientists and doctors to further their studies and provide potential therapy targets for clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Vividness of Motor Imagery Is Correlated With Corticospinal Excitability During Combined Motor Imagery and Action Observation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between motor imagery (MI) assessment (ability and quality) and neurophysiological assessment [transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor-evoked potentials (MEPs)] during combined MI and action observation (AO; MI + AO). Sixteen subjects completed an MI task playing the piano with both hands, and neurophysiological assessment was performed during the MI task. The Movement Imagery Questionnaire-Revised was adopted to evaluate MI ability, while the visual analogue scale (VAS) was adopted to evaluate MI quality. A TMS pulse was delivered during the MI task, and MEPs were subsequently recorded in the abductor pollicis brevis (APB). We found a significant positive correlation between the VAS score and the TMS-induced MEPs (ρ = 0.497, p &amp;lt; 0.001). These findings suggest that the VAS score could potentially reflect the corticospinal excitability during MI + AO, particularly in complex MI tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Feeling Is Mutual: Clarity of Haptics-Mediated Social Perception Is Not Associated With the Recognition of the Other, Only With Recognition of Each Other</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.560567</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.560567</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The enactive theory of perception hypothesizes that perceptual access to objects depends on the mastery of sensorimotor contingencies, that is, on the know-how of the regular ways in which changes in sensations depend on changes in movements. This hypothesis can be extended into the social domain: perception of other minds is constituted by mastery of self-other contingencies, that is, by the know-how of the regular ways in which changes in others’ movements depend on changes in one’s movements. We investigated this proposal using the perceptual crossing paradigm, in which pairs of players are required to locate each other in an invisible one-dimensional virtual space by using a minimal haptic interface. We recorded and analyzed the real-time embodied social interaction of 10 pairs of adult participants. The results reveal a process of implicit perceptual learning: on average, clarity of perceiving the other’s presence increased over trials and then stabilized. However, a clearer perception of the other was not associated with correctness of recognition as such, but with both players correctly recognizing each other. Furthermore, the moments of correct mutual recognition tended to happen within seconds. The fact that changes in social experience can only be explained by the successful performance at the level of the dyad, and that this veridical mutual perception tends toward synchronization, lead us to hypothesize that integration of neural activity across both players played a role.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Suppression of Taboo Word Spoonerisms Is Associated With Altered Medial Frontal Negativity: An ERP Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The constant internal monitoring of speech is a crucial feature to ensure the fairly error-free process of speech production. It has been argued that internal speech monitoring takes place through detection of conflict between different response options or “speech plans.” Speech errors are thought to occur because two (or more) competing speech plans become activated, and the speaker is unable to inhibit the erroneous plan(s) prior to vocalization. A prime example for a speech plan that has to be suppressed is the involuntary utterance of a taboo word. The present study seeks to examine the suppression of involuntary taboo word utterances. We used the “Spoonerisms of Laboratory Induced Predisposition” (SLIP) paradigm to elicit two competing speech plans, one being correct and one embodying either a taboo word or a non-taboo word spoonerism. Behavioral data showed that inadequate speech plans generally were effectively suppressed, although more effectively in the taboo word spoonerism condition. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis revealed a broad medial frontal negativity (MFN) after the target word pair presentation, interpreted as reflecting conflict detection and resolution to suppress the inadequate speech plan. The MFN was found to be more pronounced in the taboo word spoonerism compared to the neutral word spoonerism condition, indicative of a higher level of conflict when subjects suppressed the involuntary utterance of taboo words.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Transient Amplitude Modulation of Alpha-Band Oscillations by Short-Time Intermittent Closed-Loop tACS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00366</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) have recently become extensively utilized due to their potential to modulate ongoing neuronal oscillatory activity and consequently to induce cortical plasticity relevant for various cognitive functions. However, the neurophysiological basis for stimulation effects as well as their inter-individual differences is not yet understood. In the present study, we used a closed-loop electroencephalography-tACS(EEG-tACS) protocol to examine the modulation of alpha oscillations generated in occipito-parietal areas. In particular, we investigated the effects of a repeated short-time intermittent stimulation protocol (1 s in every trial) applied over the visual cortex (Cz and Oz) and adjusted according to the phase and frequency of visual alpha oscillations on the amplitude of these oscillations. Based on previous findings, we expected higher increases in alpha amplitudes for tACS applied in-phase with ongoing oscillations as compared to an application in anti-phase and this modulation to be present in low-alpha amplitude states of the visual system (eyes opened, EO) but not high (eyes closed, EC). Contrary to our expectations, we found a transient suppression of alpha power in inter-individually derived spatially specific parieto-occipital components obtained via the estimation of spatial filters by using the common spatial patterns approach. The amplitude modulation was independent of the phase relationship between the tACS signal and alpha oscillations, and the state of the visual system manipulated via closed- and open-eye conditions. It was also absent in conventionally analyzed single-channel and multi-channel data from an average parieto-occipital region. The fact that the tACS modulation of oscillations was phase-independent suggests that mechanisms driving the effects of tACS may not be explained by entrainment alone, but rather require neuroplastic changes or transient disruption of neural oscillations. Our study also supports the notion that the response to tACS is subject-specific, where the modulatory effects are shaped by the interplay between the stimulation and different alpha generators. This favors stimulation protocols as well as analysis regimes exploiting inter-individual differences, such as spatial filters to reveal otherwise hidden stimulation effects and, thereby, comprehensively induce and study the effects and underlying mechanisms of tACS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Altered Topological Properties of Brain Structural Covariance Networks in Patients With Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00364</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Brain structural alterations play an important role in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). However, while there have been studies on regional brain structural alterations, only few studies have focused on the topological organization of the brain structural covariance network. This work aimed to describe the structural covariance network architecture alterations that are possibly linked to cortex reorganization in patients with CSM.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;High-resolution anatomical images of 31 CSM patients and 31 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the study. The images were acquired using a sagittal three-dimensional T1-weighted BRAVO sequence. Firstly, the gray matter volume of 90 brain regions of automated anatomical labeling atlas were computed using a VBM toolbox based on the DARTEL algorithm. Then, the brain structural covariance network was constructed by thresholding the gray matter volume correlation matrices. Subsequently, the network measures and nodal property were calculated based on graph theory. Finally, the differences in the network metrics and nodal property between groups were compared using a non-parametric test.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Patients with CSM showed larger global efficiency and smaller local efficiency, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and sigma values than HCs. Patients with CSM had greater betweenness in the left superior parietal gyrus (SPG.L) and the left supplementary motor area (SMA.L) than HCs. Besides, patients with CSM had smaller betweenness in right middle occipital gyrus. The brain structural covariance networks of CSM patients exhibited equal resilience to random failure as those of HCs. However, the maximum relative size of giant connected components was approximately 10% larger in HCs than in CSM patients, upon removal of 44 nodes in targeted attack.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These observed alternations in global network measures in CSM patients reflect that the brain structural covariance network in CSM exhibits the less optimal small-world model compared to that in HCs. Increased betweenness in SPG.L and SMA.L seems to be related to cortex reorganization to recover multiple sensory functions after spinal cord injury in CSM patients. The network resilience of patients with CSM exhibiting a relative mild vulnerability, compared to HCs, is probably attributable to the balance and interplay between cortex reorganization and ongoing degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Decline Variability of Cortical and Subcortical Regions in Aging: A Longitudinal Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Describing the trajectories of age-related change for different brain structures has been of interest in many recent studies. However, our knowledge regarding these trajectories and their associations is still limited due to small sample sizes and low numbers of repeated measures. For the present study, we used a large longitudinal dataset (four measurements over 4 years) comprising anatomical data from a sample of healthy older adults (N = 231 at baseline). This dataset enables us to gain new insights about volumetric cortical and subcortical changes and their associations in the context of healthy aging. Brain structure volumes were derived from T1-weighted MRI scans using FreeSurfer segmentation tools. Brain structure trajectories were fitted using mixed models and latent growth curve models to gain information about the mean extent and variability of decline trajectories for different brain structures as well as the associations between individual trajectories. On the group level, our analyses indicate similar linear changes for frontal and parietal brain regions, while medial temporal regions showed an accelerated decline with advancing age. Regarding subcortical regions, some structures showed strong declines (e.g., hippocampus), others showed little decline (e.g., pallidum). Our data provide little evidence for sex differences regarding the aforementioned trajectories. Between-person variability of the person-specific slopes (random slopes) was largest in subcortical and medial temporal brain structures. When looking at the associations between the random slopes from each brain structure, we found that the decline is largely homogenous across the majority of cortical brain structures. In subcortical and medial temporal brain structures, however, more heterogeneity of the decline was observed, meaning that the extent of the decline in one structure is less predictive of the decline in another structure. Taken together, our study contributes to enhancing our understanding of structural brain aging by demonstrating (1) that average volumetric change differs across the brain and (2) that there are regional differences with respect to between-person variability in the slopes. Moreover, our data suggest (3) that random slopes are highly correlated across large parts of the cerebral cortex but (4) that some brain regions (i.e., medial temporal regions) deviate from this homogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Computational Model of the Cholinergic Modulation of CA1 Pyramidal Cell Activity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunction in cholinergic modulation has been linked to a variety of cognitive disorders including Alzheimer's disease. The important role of this neurotransmitter has been explored in a variety of experiments, yet many questions remain unanswered about the contribution of cholinergic modulation to healthy hippocampal function. To address this question, we have developed a model of CA1 pyramidal neuron that takes into consideration muscarinic receptor activation in response to changes in extracellular concentration of acetylcholine and its effects on cellular excitability and downstream intracellular calcium dynamics. This model incorporates a variety of molecular agents to accurately simulate several processes heretofore ignored in computational modeling of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These processes include the inhibition of ionic channels by phospholipid depletion along with the release of calcium from intracellular stores (i.e., the endoplasmic reticulum). This paper describes the model and the methods used to calibrate its behavior to match experimental results. The result of this work is a compartmental model with calibrated mechanisms for simulating the intracellular calcium dynamics of CA1 pyramidal cells with a focus on those related to release from calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. From this model we also make various predictions for how the inhibitory and excitatory responses to cholinergic modulation vary with agonist concentration. This model expands the capabilities of CA1 pyramidal cell models through the explicit modeling of molecular interactions involved in healthy cognitive function and disease. Through this expanded model we come closer to simulating these diseases and gaining the knowledge required to develop novel treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Willin/FRMD6 Influences Mechanical Phenotype and Neuronal Differentiation in Mammalian Cells by Regulating ERK1/2 Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.552213</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.552213</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Willin/FRMD6 is part of a family of proteins with a 4.1 ezrin-radixin-moesin (FERM) domain. It has been identified as an upstream activator of the Hippo pathway and, when aberrant in its expression, is associated with human diseases and disorders. Even though Willin/FRMD6 was originally discovered in the rat sciatic nerve, most studies have focused on its functional roles in cells outside of the nervous system, where Willin/FRMD6 is involved in the formation of apical junctional cell-cell complexes and in regulating cell migration. Here, we investigate the biochemical and biophysical role of Willin/FRMD6 in neuronal cells, employing the commonly used SH-SY5Y neuronal model cell system and combining biochemical measurements with Elastic Resonator Interference Stress Micropscopy (ERISM). We present the first direct evidence that Willin/FRMD6 expression influences both the cell mechanical phenotype and neuronal differentiation. By investigating cells with increased and decreased Willin/FRMD6 expression levels, we show that Willin/FRMD6 not only affects proliferation and migration capacity of cells but also leads to changes in cell morphology and an enhanced formation of neurite-like membrane extensions. These changes were accompanied by alterations of biophysical parameters such as cell force, the organization of actin stress fibers and the formation of focal adhesions. At the biochemical level, changes in Willin/FRMD6 expression inversely affected the activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway and downstream transcriptional factor NeuroD1, which seems to prime SH-SY5Y cells for retinoic acid (RA)-induced neuronal differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Notoginsenoside R1–Induced Neuronal Repair in Models of Alzheimer Disease Is Associated With an Alteration in Neuronal Hyperexcitability, Which Is Regulated by Nav</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00280</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease is characterized by a progressive cognitive deficit and may be associated with an aberrant hyperexcitability of the neuronal network. Notoginsenoside R1 (R1), a major activity ingredient from Panax notoginseng, has demonstrated favorable changes in neuronal plasticity and induced neuroprotective effects in brain injuries, resulting from various disorders, however, the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. In the present study, we aimed to explore the possible neuroprotective effects induced by R1 in a mouse model of AD and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Treatment with R1 significantly improved learning and memory functions and redressed neuronal hyperexcitability in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 mice by altering the numbers and/or distribution of the members of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav). Moreover, we determined whether R1 contributed to the regulation of neuronal excitability in Aβ-42–injured cells. Results of our study demonstrated that treatment with R1 rescued Aβ1-42–induced injured neurons by increasing cell viability. R1-induced alleviation in neuronal hyperexcitability might be associated with reduced Navβ2 cleavage, which partially reversed the abnormal distribution of Nav1.1α. These results suggested that R1 played a vital role in the recovery of Aβ1-42–induced neuronal injury and hyperexcitability, which is regulated by Nav proteins. Therefore, R1 may be a promising candidate in the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: S100B Impairs Oligodendrogenesis and Myelin Repair Following Demyelination Through RAGE Engagement</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00279</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00279</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increased expression of S100B and its specific receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been described in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), being associated with an active demyelinating process. We previously showed that a direct neutralization of S100B reduces lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced demyelination and inflammation using an ex vivo demyelinating model. However, whether S100B actions occur through RAGE and how oligodendrogenesis and remyelination are affected are not clarified. To evaluate the role of the S100B–RAGE axis in the course of a demyelinating insult, organotypic cerebellar slice cultures (OCSC) were demyelinated with LPC in the presence or absence of RAGE antagonist FPS-ZM1. Then, we explored the effects of the S100B–RAGE axis inhibition on glia reactivity and inflammation, myelination and neuronal integrity, and on oligodendrogenesis and remyelination. In the present study, we confirmed that LPC-induced demyelination increased S100B and RAGE expression, while RAGE antagonist FPS-ZM1 markedly reduced their content and altered RAGE cellular localization. Furthermore, FPS-ZM1 prevented LPC-induced microgliosis and astrogliosis, as well as NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression. In addition, RAGE antagonist reduced LPC-induced demyelination having a beneficial effect on axonal and synaptic protein preservation. We have also observed that RAGE engagement is needed for LPC-induced oligodendrocyte (OL) maturation arrest and loss of mature myelinating OL, with these phenomena being prevented by FPS-ZM1. Our data suggest that increased levels of mature OL in the presence of FPS-ZM1 are related to increased expression of microRNAs (miRs) associated with OL differentiation and remyelination, such as miR-23a, miR-219a, and miR-338, which are defective upon LPC incubation. Finally, our electron microscopy data show that inhibition of the S100B–RAGE axis prevents axonal damage and myelin loss, in parallel with enhanced functional remyelination, as observed by the presence of thinner myelin sheaths when compared with Control. Overall, our data implicate the S100B–RAGE axis in the extent of myelin and neuronal damage, as well as in the inflammatory response that follows a demyelinating insult. Thus, prevention of RAGE engagement may represent a novel strategy for promoting not only inflammatory reduction but also neuronal and myelin preservation and/or remyelination, improving recovery in a demyelinating condition as MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Synaptic Plasticity in Cortical Inhibitory Neurons: What Mechanisms May Help to Balance Synaptic Weight Changes?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00204</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00204</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory neurons play a fundamental role in the normal operation of neuronal networks. Diverse types of inhibitory neurons serve vital functions in cortical networks, such as balancing excitation and taming excessive activity, organizing neuronal activity in spatial and temporal patterns, and shaping response selectivity. Serving these, and a multitude of other functions effectively requires fine-tuning of inhibition, mediated by synaptic plasticity. Plasticity of inhibitory systems can be mediated by changes at inhibitory synapses and/or by changes at excitatory synapses at inhibitory neurons. In this review, we consider that latter locus: plasticity at excitatory synapses to inhibitory neurons. Despite the fact that plasticity of excitatory synaptic transmission to interneurons has been studied in much less detail than in pyramids and other excitatory cells, an abundance of forms and mechanisms of plasticity have been observed in interneurons. Specific requirements and rules for induction, while exhibiting a broad diversity, could correlate with distinct sources of excitatory inputs and distinct types of inhibitory neurons. One common requirement for the induction of plasticity is the rise of intracellular calcium, which could be mediated by a variety of ligand-gated, voltage-dependent, and intrinsic mechanisms. The majority of the investigated forms of plasticity can be classified as Hebbian-type associative plasticity. Hebbian-type learning rules mediate adaptive changes of synaptic transmission. However, these rules also introduce intrinsic positive feedback on synaptic weight changes, making plastic synapses and learning networks prone to runaway dynamics. Because real inhibitory neurons do not express runaway dynamics, additional plasticity mechanisms that counteract imbalances introduced by Hebbian-type rules must exist. We argue that weight-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity has a number of characteristics that make it an ideal candidate mechanism to achieve homeostatic regulation of synaptic weight changes at excitatory synapses to inhibitory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Dual Nature of Onuf’s Nucleus: Neuroanatomical Features and Peculiarities, in Health and Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.572013</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Onuf’s nucleus is a small group of neurons located in the ventral horns of the sacral spinal cord. The motor neurons (MNs) of Onuf’s nucleus innervate striated voluntary muscles of the pelvic floor and are histologically and biochemically comparable to the other somatic spinal MNs. However, curiously, these neurons also show some autonomic-like features as, for instance, they receive a strong peptidergic innervation. The review provides an overview of the histological, biochemical, metabolic, and gene expression peculiarities of Onuf’s nucleus. Moreover, it describes the aging-related pathologies as well as several traumatic and neurodegenerative disorders in which its neurons are involved: indeed, Onuf’s nucleus is affected in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Shy-Drager Syndrome (SDS), whereas it is spared in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). We summarize here the milestone studies that have contributed to clarifying the nature of Onuf’s neurons and in understanding what makes them either vulnerable or resistant to damage. Altogether, these works can offer the possibility to develop new therapeutic strategies for counteracting neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: IL-17A Neutralization Improves the Neurological Outcome of Mice With Ischemic Stroke and Inhibits Caspase-12-Dependent Apoptosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00274</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00274</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that the levels of astrocyte-derived interleukin-17A (IL-17A) increased both in the peri-infarct region and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mice with 1-h middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion/12-h reperfusion (1-h MCAO/R 12 h)-induced ischemic stroke. However, the effects of IL-17A neutralization on the neurological outcome of mice with ischemic stroke and its underlying molecular mechanism are unclear. In this study, we found that the intracerebroventricular injection of IL-17A-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb; 2.0 μg) could reduce the infarct volume, alleviate neuron loss, and improve the neurological outcomes of mice with 1-h MCAO/R 24-h- or 3-day-induced ischemic-stroke mice. The IL-17A neutralization could also significantly inhibit the increase of pro-caspase-3 cleavage through caspase-12-dependent cell apoptosis, as well as preventing the decrease of antiapoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and the increase of proapoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in the peri-infarct region of mice following ischemic stroke. In addition, we confirmed that the recombinant mouse (rm) IL-17A could significantly aggravate 1-h oxygen–glucose deprivation/24-h reoxygenation (1-h OGD/R 24 h)-induced ischemic injuries in cortical neurons in a dose-dependent manner, and the rmIL-17A could also exacerbate neuronal apoptosis through caspase-12 (not caspase-8 or caspase-9)-dependent pathway. These results suggest that IL-17A neutralization could improve the neurological outcome of mice with ischemic stroke through inhibiting caspase-12-dependent neuronal apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Systematic Review of the Diagnostic Validity of Brief Cognitive Screenings for Early Dementia Detection in Spanish-Speaking Adults in Latin America</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00270</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of brief cognitive screening (BCS) tools designed to diagnose mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in Spanish-speaking individuals over the age of 50 years from Latin America (LA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic search of titles and abstracts in Medline, Biomed Central, Embase, Scopus, Scirus, PsycINFO, LILACS, and SciELO was conducted. Inclusion criteria were papers written in English or Spanish involving samples from Spanish-speaking Latin American individuals published until 2018. Standard procedures were applied for reviewing the literature. The data related to the study sample, methodology, and procedures applied, as well as the performance obtained with the corresponding BCS, were collected and systematized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirteen of 211 articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies primarily involved memory clinic-based samples, with the exception of two studies from an adult day-care center, one from a primary care clinic, and one from a community-based sample. All the studies originated from five of the 20 countries of LA and all used standardized diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dementia and MCI; however, the diagnostic protocols applied differed. Most studies reported samples with an average of 10 years of education and only one reported a sample with an average of &amp;lt;5 years of education. No publication to date has included an illiterate population. Although the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) is the most widely-used BCS tool in LA, it is significantly influenced by education level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Although evidence is still limited, the findings from studies on LA populations suggest that MoCA requires cultural adaptations and different cutoff points according to education level. Moreover, the diagnostic validity of the INECO frontal screening (IFS) test should be evaluated in populations with a low level of education. Given the heterogeneity that exists in the levels of education in LA, more studies involving illiterate and indigenous populations are required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Identifying Early Mild Cognitive Impairment by Multi-Modality MRI-Based Deep Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00206</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00206</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical state with a high risk of conversion to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Since there is no effective treatment for AD, it is extremely important to diagnose MCI as early as possible, as this makes it possible to delay its progression toward AD. However, it's challenging to identify early MCI (EMCI) because there are only mild changes in the brain structures of patients compared with a normal control (NC). To extract remarkable features for these mild changes, in this paper, a multi-modality diagnosis approach based on deep learning is presented. Firstly, we propose to use structure MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images as the multi-modality data to identify EMCI. Then, a convolutional neural network based on transfer learning technique is developed to extract features of the multi-modality data, where an L1-norm is introduced to reduce the feature dimensionality and retrieve essential features for the identification. At last, the classifier produces 94.2% accuracy for EMCI vs. NC on an ADNI dataset. Experimental results show that multi-modality data can provide more useful information to distinguish EMCI from NC compared with single modality data, and the proposed method can improve classification performance, which is beneficial to early intervention of AD. In addition, it is found that DTI image can act as an important biomarker for EMCI from the point of view of a clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Why is cyclic dominance so rare?</title>

	<description>Natural populations can contain multiple types of coexisting individuals. How does natural selection maintain such diversity within and across populations? A popular theoretical basis for the maintenance of diversity is cyclic dominance, illustrated by the rock-paper-scissor game. However, it appears difficult to find cyclic dominance in nature. Why is this the case? Focusing on continuously produced novel mutations, we theoretically addressed the rareness of cyclic dominance. We developed a model of an evolving population and studied the formation of cyclic dominance. Our results showed that the chance for cyclic dominance to emerge is lower when the newly introduced type is similar to existing types compared to the introduction of an unrelated type. This suggests that cyclic dominance is more likely to evolve through the assembly of unrelated types whereas it rarely evolves within a community of similar types.</description>

	<description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of cellular respiration that can promote oxidative stress and damage cellular proteins and lipids. One canonical role of ROS is to defend the cell against invading bacterial and viral pathogens. Curiously, some viruses, including herpesviruses, thrive despite the induction of ROS, suggesting that ROS are beneficial for the virus. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that ROS impaired interferon response during murine herpesvirus infection and that the inhibition occurred downstream of cytoplasmic DNA sensing. We further demonstrated that ROS suppressed the type I interferon response by oxidizing Cysteine 147 on murine stimulator of interferon genes (STING), an ER-associated protein that mediates interferon response after cytoplasmic DNA sensing. This inhibited STING polymerization and activation of downstream signaling events. These data indicate that redox regulation of Cysteine 147 of mouse STING, which is equivalent to Cysteine 148 of human STING, controls interferon production. Together, our findings reveal that ROS orchestrates anti-viral immune responses, which can be exploited by viruses to evade cellular defenses.</description>

	<title>eLife: Molecular basis for N-terminal alpha-synuclein acetylation by human NatB</title>

	<description>NatB is one of three major N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) complexes (NatA-NatC), which co-translationally acetylate the N-termini of eukaryotic proteins. Its substrates account for about 21% of the human proteome, including well known proteins such as actin, tropomyosin, CDK2, and α-synuclein (aSyn). Human NatB (hNatB) mediated N-terminal acetylation of αSyn has been demonstrated to play key roles in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of hNatB bound to a CoA-aSyn conjugate, together with structure-guided analysis of mutational effects on catalysis. This analysis reveals functionally important differences with human NatA and &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans &lt;/i&gt;NatB, resolves key hNatB protein determinants for aSyn N-terminal acetylation, and identifies important residues for substrate-specific recognition and acetylation by NatB enzymes. These studies have implications for developing small molecule NatB probes and for understanding the mode of substrate selection by NAT enzymes.</description>

	<description>One of the features distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from its more pathogenic counterpart SARS-CoV is the presence of premature stop codons in its ORF3b gene. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent interferon antagonist, suppressing the induction of type I interferon more efficiently than its SARS-CoV ortholog. Phylogenetic analyses and functional assays reveal that SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from bats and pangolins also encode truncated ORF3b gene products with strong anti-interferon activity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: CyDAP-A fluorescent probe for cytosolic dopamine detection</title>

	<description>Dopamine (DA) is an essential neurotransmitter modulating motor and cognitive functions. Several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and drug addiction, are the result of DA system dysfunction; however, it remains incomplete understood of why DA neuron is selectively more vulnerable than other neurons. Here we utilize the spectral feature of human MAO B (monoamine oxidase B) to design a genetic-amenable, GFP-based fluorescent probe CyDAP. Upon genetic and pharmacological manipulations to elevate the cytosolic DA levels in cells and Drosophila models, CyDAP shows enhanced GFP emission, suggesting this probe is feasible for DA detection. Furthermore, we observe that expressing human -Synuclein in Drosophila elicited GFP emission from CyDAP, suggesting a link between cytosolic DA imbalance and regional vulnerability in PD context. Importantly, CyDAP can detect the change of cytosolic DA in live Drosophila brains, as demonstrated by time-lapse and the 4D light-sheet confocal recording. CyDAP may serve as a tool for evaluating metabolic deregulation of DA in brain models of PD and other DA system-related psychiatric disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Asymmetric Functional Gradients in the Human Subcortex</title>

	<description>A central principle in our understanding of cerebral cortical organization is that homotopic left and right areas are functionally linked to each other, and also connected with structures that share similar functions within each cerebral cortical hemisphere. Here we refer to this concept as interhemispheric functional symmetry (IHFS). While multiple studies have described the distribution and variations of IHFS in the cerebral cortex, descriptions of IHFS in the subcortex are largely absent in the neuroscientific literature. Further, the proposed anatomical basis of IHFS is centered on callosal and other commissural tracts. These commissural fibers are present in virtually all cerebral cortical areas, but almost absent in the subcortex. There is thus an important knowledge gap in our understanding of subcortical IHFS. What is the distribution and variations of subcortical IHFS, and what are the anatomical correlates and physiological implications of this important property in the subcortex? Using fMRI functional gradient analyses in a large dataset (Human Connectome Project, n=1003), here we explored IHFS in human thalamus, lenticular nucleus, cerebellar cortex, and caudate nucleus. Our detailed descriptions provide an empirical foundation upon which to build hypotheses for the anatomical and physiological basis of subcortical IHFS. Our results indicate that direct or driver cerebral cortical afferent connectivity, as opposed to indirect or modulatory cerebral cortical afferent connectivity, is associated with stronger subcortical IHFS in thalamus and lenticular nucleus. In cerebellar cortex and caudate, where there is no variability in terms of either direct vs. indirect or driver vs. modulatory cerebral cortical afferent connections, connectivity to cerebral cortical areas with stronger cerebral cortical IHFS is associated with stronger IHFS in the subcortex. These two observations support a close relationship between subcortical IHFS and connectivity between subcortex and cortex, and generate new testable hypotheses that advance our understanding of subcortical organization.</description>

	<description>Two-photon microscopy together with fluorescent proteins and fluorescent protein-based biosensors are commonly used tools in neuroscience. To enhance their experimental scope, it is important to optimize fluorescent proteins for two-photon excitation. Directed evolution of fluorescent proteins under one-photon excitation is common, but many one-photon properties do not correlate with two-photon properties. A simple system for expressing fluorescent protein mutants is E. coli colonies on an agar plate. The small focal volume of two-photon excitation makes creating a high throughput screen in this system a challenge for a conventional point-scanning approach. We present an instrument and accompanying software that solves this challenge by selectively scanning each colony based on a colony map captured under one-photon excitation. This instrument, called the GIZMO, can measure the two-photon excited fluorescence of 10,000 E. coli colonies in 7 hours. We show that the GIZMO can be used to evolve a fluorescent protein under two-photon excitation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Mutagenesis of the Orco Odorant Receptor Co-receptor Impairs Olfactory Function in the Malaria Vector Anopheles coluzzii</title>

	<description>Mosquitoes rely heavily on their olfactory systems for host seeking, selection of oviposition sites, and avoiding predators and other environmental dangers. Of these behaviors, the preferential selection of a human blood-meal host drives the vectorial capacity of anthropophilic female Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are dispersed across several appendages on the head and express an obligate odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) coupled with a tuning odorant receptor (OR) to form heteromeric, odor-gated ion channels in the membrane of these neurons. To examine the mechanistic and functional contributions of Orco/OR complexes to the chemosensory processes of An. coluzzii, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to create a line of homozygous, Orco-knockout, mutant mosquitoes. As expected, orco-/- ORNs across both adult and larval stages of An. coluzzii display significantly lower background activity and lack nearly all odor-evoked responses. In addition, blood-meal-seeking, adult female, orco-/- mutant mosquitoes exhibit severely reduced attraction to human- and non-human-derived odors while gravid females are significantly less responsive to established oviposition attractants. These results reinforce observations in other insects that Orco is crucial in maintaining the activity of ORNs. In that light, it significantly influences a range of olfactory-driven behaviors central to the anthropophilic host preference that is critical to the vectorial capacity of An. coluzzii as a primary vector for human malaria.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Two cortical representations of voice control are differentially involved in speech fluency</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.04.283275v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Recent studies have identified two distinct cortical representations of voice control in humans, the ventral and the dorsal laryngeal motor cortex. Strikingly, while persistent developmental stuttering has been linked to a white matter deficit in the ventral laryngeal motor cortex, intensive fluency shaping intervention modulated the functional connectivity of the dorsal laryngeal motor cortical network. Currently, it is unknown whether the underlying structural network organization of these two laryngeal representations is distinct or differently shaped by stuttering intervention. Using probabilistic diffusion tractography in 22 individuals who stutter and participated in a fluency shaping intervention, in 18 individuals who stutter and did not participate in the intervention, and in 28 control participants, we here compare structural networks of the dorsal laryngeal motor cortex and the ventral laryngeal motor cortex and test intervention-related white matter changes. We show (i) that all participants have weaker ventral laryngeal motor cortex connections compared to the dorsal laryngeal motor cortex network, regardless of speech fluency, (ii) connections of the ventral laryngeal motor cortex were stronger in fluent speakers, (iii) the connectivity profile of the ventral laryngeal motor cortex predicted stuttering severity, (iv) but the ventral laryngeal motor cortex network is resistant to a fluency shaping intervention. Our findings substantiate a weaker structural organization of the ventral laryngeal motor cortical network in developmental stuttering and imply that assisted recovery supports neural compensation rather than normalization. Moreover, the resulting dissociation provides evidence for functionally segregated roles of the ventral laryngeal motor cortical and dorsal laryngeal motor cortical networks.</description>

	<description>To search for general principles underlying neuronal regulatory programs we built an RNA interference library against all transcription factors (TFs) encoded in C. elegans genome and systematically screened for specification defects in ten different neuron types of the monoaminergic (MA) superclass. We identified over 90 TFs involved in MA specification, with at least ten different TFs controlling differentiation of each individual neuron type. These TFs belong predominantly to five TF families (HD, bHLH, ZF, bZIP and NHR). Next, focusing on the complexity of terminal differentiation, we identified and functionally characterized the dopaminergic terminal regulatory program. We found that seven TFs from four different families act in a TF collective to provide genetic robustness and to impose a specific gene regulatory signature enriched in the regulatory regions of dopamine effector genes. Our results provide new insights on neuron-type regulatory programs that could help better understand specification and evolution of neuron types.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Similarity of brain activity patterns during learning and subsequent resting state predicts memory consolidation</title>

	<description>Long-term memory depends on memory consolidation that seems to rely on learning-induced changes in the brain activity. Here, we introduced a novel approach analyzing continuous EEG data to study learning-induced changes as well as trait-like characteristics in brain activity underlying consolidation. Thirty-one healthy young adults performed a learning task and their performance was retested after a short (~1h) delay, that enabled us to investigate the consolidation of serial-order and probability information simultaneously. EEG was recorded during a pre- and post-learning rest period and during learning. To investigate the brain activity associated with consolidation performance, we quantified similarities in EEG functional connectivity of learning and pre-learning rest (baseline similarity) as well as learning and post-learning rest (post-learning similarity). While comparable patterns of these two could indicate trait-like similarities, changes in similarity from baseline to post-learning could indicate learning-induced changes, possibly spontaneous reactivation. Individuals with higher learning-induced changes in alpha frequency connectivity (8.5-9.5 Hz) showed better consolidation of serial-order information. This effect was stronger for more distant channels, highlighting the role of long-range centro-parietal networks underlying the consolidation of serial-order information. The consolidation of probability information was associated with learning-induced changes in delta frequency connectivity (2.5-3 Hz) and seemed to be dependent on more local, short-range connections. Beyond these associations with learning-induced changes, we also found substantial overlap between the baseline and post-learning similarity and their associations with consolidation performance, indicating that stable (trait-like) differences in functional connectivity networks may also be crucial for memory consolidation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: mTOR inhibition in primary neurons and the developing brain represses transcription of cholesterol biosynthesis genes and alters cholesterol levels</title>

	<description>Dysregulated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity is associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders ranging from idiopathic autism spectrum disorders to monogenic syndromes as for example Tuberous sclerosis complex. Thus, maintaining mTOR activity levels in a physiological range is essential for brain development and functioning. Upon activation, mTOR regulates a variety of cellular processes such as cell growth, autophagy and metabolism. On a molecular level, however, the consequences of mTOR activation are not well understood, especially in the brain. Thus, while it was shown that in cells outside the central nervous system mTORC1 activity is necessary for activating gene transcription of different metabolic pathways this mechanism is ill defined in the brain. By combining mTORC1 inhibition with RNA-sequencing we identified numerous genes of the sterol/cholesterol biosynthesis pathway to be downstream targets of mTORC1 in vitro in primary neurons and in vivo in the developing cerebral cortex of the mouse. Of note, reduced expression of these genes upon mTORC1 inhibition translated into reduced cholesterol levels. We further show that while mTORC1 does not regulate chromatin accessibility or RNA stability of these genes it drives transcription of their DNA. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified binding sites for the transcription factors SREBP, SP1 and NF-Y to be enriched in the promoters of mTORC1 target genes and confirmed binding of NF-YA by ChIP-qPCR. Altogether, our results indicate that mTORC1 is an important regulator of the expression of sterol/cholesterol biosynthesis genes in the developing brain. Altered expression of these genes may be an important contributing factor in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with dysregulated mTOR signaling.</description>

	<description>Sustained attention has long been thought to benefit perception in a continuous fashion, but recent evidence suggests that it affects perception in a discrete, rhythmic way. Periodic fluctuations in behavioral performance over time, and modulations of behavioral performance by the phase of spontaneous oscillatory brain activity point to an attentional sampling rate in the theta or alpha frequency range. We investigated whether such discrete sampling by attention is reflected in periodic fluctuations in the decodability of visual stimulus orientation from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain signals. In this exploratory study, human subjects attended one of two grating stimuli while MEG was being recorded. We assessed the strength of the visual representation of the attended stimulus using a support vector machine (SVM) to decode the orientation of the grating (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) from the MEG signal. We tested whether decoder performance depended on the theta/alpha phase of local brain activity. While the phase of ongoing activity in visual cortex did not modulate decoding performance, theta/alpha phase of activity in the FEF and parietal cortex, contralateral to the attended stimulus did modulate decoding performance. These findings suggest that phasic modulations of visual stimulus representations in the brain are caused by frequency-specific top-down activity in the fronto-parietal attention network.</description>

	<description>While sexual dimorphism in courtship and copulation behavior is common in the animal kingdom, sexual dimorphism in feeding behavior is rare. The Aedes aegypti mosquito provides an example of extreme sexual dimorphism in feeding, because only the females show strong attraction to humans, and bite them to obtain a blood-meal necessary to stimulate egg production. The genetic basis of this complex, modular, and sexually dimorphic feeding behavior is unknown. The fruitless gene is sex-specifically spliced in the brain of multiple insect species including mosquitoes and encodes a BTB zinc-finger transcription factor that has been proposed to be a master regulator of male courtship and mating behavior across insects. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 to mutate the fruitless gene in male mosquitoes. fruitless mutant males fail to mate, confirming the ancestral function of this gene in male sexual behavior. Remarkably, fruitless mutant males also gain strong attraction to a live human host, a behavior that wild-type males never display. Humans produce multiple sensory cues that attract mosquitoes and we show that fruitless specifically controls host-seeking in response to human odor. These results suggest that male mosquitoes possess the neural circuits required to host-seek and that removing fruitless reveals this latent behavior in males. Our results highlight an unexpected repurposing of a master regulator of male-specific sexual behavior to control one module of female-specific blood-feeding behavior in a deadly vector of infectious diseases.</description>

	<description>Segregation and integration are two fundamental principles of brain structural and functional organization. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the brain transits between different functionally segregated and integrated states, and neuromodulatory systems have been proposed as key to facilitate these transitions. Although computational models have reproduced the effect of neuromodulation at the whole-brain level, the role of local inhibitory circuits and their cholinergic modulation has not been studied. In this article, we consider a Jansen &amp;amp; Rit whole-brain model in a network interconnected using a human connectome, and study the influence of the cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulatory systems on the segregation/integration balance. In our model, a newly introduced local inhibitory feedback enables the integration of whole-brain activity, and its modulation interacts with the other neuromodulatory influences to facilitate the transit between different functional states. Our work proposes a new possible mechanism behind segregation and integration in the brain.</description>

	<description>Previous research suggests that there is an interaction between cognitive and motor processes. This has been investigated throughout development and in different conditions related to motor impairment. The current study addressed a gap in the literature by investigating this interaction in the general population of healthy adults with different profiles of motor proficiency by focusing on error-related cognitive control and behavioural adaptation mechanisms. In addition, the impact of these processes was assessed in terms of experienced anxiety. Forty healthy adults were divided into high and low motor proficiency groups based on an assessment of their motor skills. Using electroencephalography (EEG) during a flanker task, error-related negativity (ERN) was measured as the neural indicator of cognitive control. Post-error slowing (PES) was measured to represent behavioural adaptation. Participants also completed an anxiety assessment questionnaire. Participants in the high motor proficiency group achieved better task accuracy and showed relatively enhanced cognitive control through increased ERN. Contrastingly, individuals in the lower motor proficiency group achieved poorer accuracy whilst showing some evidence of compensation through increased PES. Anxiety was found to be associated with motor functioning, but the study could not provide evidence that this was related to cognitive or behavioural control mechanisms. The interaction between cognitive and motor processes observed in this study is unique for healthy and sub-clinical populations and provides a baseline for the interpretation of similar investigations in individuals with motor disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Fruitless decommissions regulatory elements to implement cell-type-specific neuronal masculinization</title>

	<description>In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, male-specific splicing and translation of the Fruitless transcription factor (FruM) alters the presence, anatomy, and/or connectivity of &amp;gt;60 types of central brain neurons that interconnect to generate male-typical behaviors. While the indispensable function of FruM in sex-specific behavior has been understood for decades, the molecular mechanisms underlying its activity remain unknown. Here, we take a genome-wide, brain-wide approach to identifying regulatory elements whose activity depends on the presence of FruM. We identify 436 high-confidence genomic regions differentially accessible in male fruitless neurons, validate candidate regions as bona-fide, differentially regulated enhancers, and describe the particular cell types in which these enhancers are active. We find that individual enhancers are not activated universally but are dedicated to specific fru+ cell types. Aside from fru itself, genes are not dedicated to or common across the fru circuit; rather, FruM appears to masculinize each cell type differently, by tweaking expression of the same effector genes used in other circuits. Finally, we find FruM motifs enriched among regulatory elements that are open in the female but closed in the male. Together, these results suggest that FruM acts cell-type-specifically to decommission regulatory elements in male fruitless neurons.</description>

	<description>Activation and modulation of sensory-guided behaviors by biogenic amines assure appropriate adaptations to changes in an insect's environment. Given its genetic tool kit Drosophila melanogaster represents an excellent model organism to study larger networks of neurons by optophysiological methods. Here, we studied stationary crawling movements of 3rd instar larvae and revealed how the octopaminergic VUM neuron system reacts during crawling behavior and tactile stimulations. We conducted calcium imaging experiments on dissections of the isolated nervous system (missing all sensory input) and found spontaneous rhythmic wave pattern of neuronal activity in VUM neuron clusters over the range of thoracic and abdominal neuromeres in the VNC. In contrast, in vivo preparations (semi-intact animals, receiving sensory input) did not reveal such spontaneous rhythmic pattern. However, tactile stimulations activated different clusters of the VUM neuron system simultaneously in these preparations. The activation intensity of VUM neurons in the VNC was correlated with the location and degree of body wall stimulation. While VUM neuron cluster near the respective location of body wall stimulation were less activated more distant cluster showed stronger activation. Repeated gentle touch stimulations led to decreased response intensities, repeated harsh stimulations resulted in increasing intensities over trials. Optophysiological signals correlated highly with crawling behavior in freely moving larvae stimulated similarly. We conclude that the octopaminergic system is strongly coupled to the neuronal pattern generator of crawling movements and that it is simultaneously activated by physical stimulation, rather intensity than sequential coded. We hope that our work raises the interest in whole biogenic network activity and shows that octopamine release does not only underlie &quot;the more the better&quot; principle but instead has a more complex function in control and modulation of insect's locomotion.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Faster model updating in autism during early sensory processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.04.279471v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.04.279471v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Recent theories of autism propose that a core deficit in autism would be a less context-sensitive weighting of prediction errors. There is also first support for this hypothesis on an early sensory level. However, an open question is whether this decreased context-sensitivity is caused by faster updating of one's model of the world (i.e. higher weighting of new information), proposed by predictive coding theories, or slower model updating. Here, we differentiated between these two hypotheses by investigating how first impressions shape the mismatch negativity (MMN), reflecting early sensory prediction error processing. Methods: An autism and matched control group (both n=27) were compared on the multi-timescale MMN paradigm, in which tones were presented that were either standard (frequently occurring) or deviant (rare), and these roles reversed every block. A well-replicated observation is that the initial model (i.e. the standard and deviant sound in the first block) influences MMN amplitudes in later blocks. If autism is characterized by faster model updating, we hypothesized that their MMN amplitudes would be less influenced by the initial context. Results: We found that MMN responses in the autism group did not differ between the initial deviant and initial standard sounds as they did in the control group. Conclusions: These results show that individuals with autism are less influenced by initial contexts, confirming that autism is characterized by faster updating of sensory models, as proposed by predictive coding accounts of autism.</description>

Spread of HIV typically involves uneven transmission patterns where some individuals spread to a large number of individuals while others to only a few or none. Such transmission heterogeneity can impact how fast and how much an epidemic spreads. Further, more efficient interventions may be achieved by taking such transmission heterogeneity into account. To address these issues, we developed two phylogenetic methods based on virus sequence data: 1) to generally detect if significant transmission heterogeneity is present, and 2) to pinpoint where in a phylogeny high-level spread is occurring. We derive inference procedures to estimate model parameters, including the amount of transmission heterogeneity, in a sampled epidemic. We show that it is possible to detect transmission heterogeneity under a wide range of simulated situations, including incomplete sampling, varying levels of heterogeneity, and including within-host genetic diversity. When evaluating real HIV-1 data from different epidemic scenarios, we found a lower level of transmission heterogeneity in slowly spreading situations and a higher level of heterogeneity in data that included a rapid outbreak, while &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and Sackin’s index (overall tree shape statistic) were similar in the two scenarios, suggesting that our new method is able to detect transmission heterogeneity in real data. We then show by simulations that targeted prevention, where we pinpoint high-level spread using a coalescence measurement, is efficient when sequence data are collected in an ongoing surveillance system. Such phylogeny-guided prevention is efficient under both single-step contact tracing as well as iterative contact tracing as compared to random intervention.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MvwPaDppxpk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Research publications and data nowadays should be publicly available on the internet and, theoretically, usable for everyone to develop further research, products, or services. The long-term accessibility of research data is, therefore, fundamental in the economy of the research production process. However, the availability of data is not sufficient by itself, but also their quality must be verifiable. Measures to ensure reuse and reproducibility need to include the entire research life cycle, from the experimental design to the generation of data, quality control, statistical analysis, interpretation, and validation of the results. Hence, high-quality records, particularly for providing a string of documents for the verifiable origin of data, are essential elements that can act as a certificate for potential users (customers). These records also improve the traceability and transparency of data and processes, therefore, improving the reliability of results. Standards for data acquisition, analysis, and documentation have been fostered in the last decade driven by grassroot initiatives of researchers and organizations such as the Research Data Alliance (RDA). Nevertheless, what is still largely missing in the life science academic research are agreed procedures for complex routine research workflows. Here, well-crafted documentation like standard operating procedures (SOPs) offer clear direction and instructions specifically designed to avoid deviations as an absolute necessity for reproducibility.
Therefore, this paper provides a standardized workflow that explains step by step how to write an SOP to be used as a starting point for appropriate research documentation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rDZ-zr8Vi1Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Since 2015, we have run a free 9-week summer program that provides non-computer science (CS) undergraduates at San Francisco State University (SFSU) with experience in coding and doing research. Undergraduate research experiences remain very limited at SFSU and elsewhere, so the summer program provides opportunities for many more students beyond the mentoring capacity of our university laboratories. In addition, we were concerned that many students from historically underrepresented (HU) groups may be unable to take advantage of traditional summer research programs because these programs require students to relocate or be available full time, which is not feasible for students who have family, work, or housing commitments. Our program, which is local and part-time, serves about 5 times as many students as a typical National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, on a smaller budget. Based on our experiences, we present 10 simple rules for busy faculty who want to create similar programs to engage non-CS HU undergraduates in computational research. Note that while some of the strategies we implement are based on evidence-based publications in the social sciences or education research literature, the original suggestions we make here are based on our trial-and-error experiences, rather than formal hypothesis testing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oFKImM6cTKk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With the ever-increasing quality and quantity of imaging data in biomedical research comes the demand for computational methodologies that enable efficient and reliable automated extraction of the quantitative information contained within these images. One of the challenges in providing such methodology is the need for tailoring algorithms to the specifics of the data, limiting their areas of application. Here we present a broadly applicable approach to quantification and classification of complex shapes and patterns in biological or other multi-component formations. This approach integrates the mapping of all shape boundaries within an image onto a global information-rich graph and machine learning on the multidimensional measures of the graph. We demonstrated the power of this method by (1) extracting subtle structural differences from visually indistinguishable images in our phenotype rescue experiments using the endothelial tube formations assay, (2) training the algorithm to identify biophysical parameters underlying the formation of different multicellular networks in our simulation model of collective cell behavior, and (3) analyzing the response of U2OS cell cultures to a broad array of small molecule perturbations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DBp9p8gQGGw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The circadian clock is a complex system that plays many important roles in most organisms. Previously, many mathematical models have been used to sharpen our understanding of the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; clock, which brought to light the roles of each transcriptional and post-translational regulations. However, the presence of both regulations, instead of either transcription or post-translation, raised curiosity of whether the combination of these two regulations is important for the clock’s system. In this study, we built a series of simplified oscillators with different regulations to study the importance of post-translational regulation (specifically, 26S proteasome degradation) in the clock system. We found that a simple transcriptional-based oscillator can already generate sustained oscillation, but the oscillation can be easily destroyed in the presence of transcriptional leakage. Coupling post-translational control with transcriptional-based oscillator in a feed-forward loop will greatly improve the robustness of the oscillator in the presence of basal leakage. Using these general models, we were able to replicate the increased variability observed in the E3 ligase mutant for both plant and mammalian clocks. With this insight, we also predict a plausible regulator of several E3 ligase genes in the plant’s clock. Thus, our results provide insights into and the plausible importance in coupling transcription and post-translation controls in the clock system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sU3VD0NWU0g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Histamine-induced biphasic activation of RhoA allows for persistent RhoA signaling</title>

The small GTPase RhoA is a central signaling enzyme that is involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics, transcription, and cell cycle progression. Many signal transduction pathways activate RhoA—for instance, Gα&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled Histamine 1 Receptor signaling via Gα&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent activation of RhoGEFs such as p63. Although multiple upstream regulators of RhoA have been identified, the temporal regulation of RhoA and the coordination of different upstream components in its regulation have not been well characterized. In this study, live-cell measurement of RhoA activation revealed a biphasic increase of RhoA activity upon histamine stimulation. We showed that the first and second phase of RhoA activity are dependent on p63 and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/PKC, respectively, and further identified phosphorylation of serine 240 on p115 RhoGEF by PKC to be the mechanistic link between PKC and RhoA. Combined approaches of computational modeling and quantitative measurement revealed that the second phase of RhoA activation is insensitive to rapid turning off of the receptor and is required for maintaining RhoA-mediated transcription after the termination of the receptor signaling. Thus, two divergent pathways enable both rapid activation and persistent signaling in receptor-mediated RhoA signaling via intricate temporal regulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cebm1BYMr4k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholinesterase and Nissl‐staining in the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin Hippocampal Formation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cetacean hippocampal formation has been noted to be one of the smallest relative to brain size of all mammals studied. This region, comprised of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum and the entorhinal cortex, is important in learning, memory, and navigation. There have been a number of studies detailing the distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the hippocampal formation of terrestrial mammals with the goal of gaining a greater understanding of some aspects of the cholinergic innervation to this region, as well as its parcellation. The present study was undertaken to describe the organization, cytoarchitecture, and distribution of AChE in the hippocampal formation of the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin (AWSD) with the view to understand similarities and differences between this aquatic mammal and terrestrial mammals. Nissl‐staining demonstrated cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal formation in the AWSD comparable to that reported in other cetaceans. In addition, the AWSD had a rich pattern of AChE staining that distinctly varied between regions and laminae. A number of differences in the distribution of AChE staining in areas comparable to those of terrestrial species reported suggested possible alterations in connectivity of this region. Overall, however, AChE‐staining suggested that cholinergic innervation, neural pathways and function of the hippocampal formation of the AWSD is conserved, similar to other mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the demonstrated implication of the retina in PD pathology and the importance of dopaminergic cells in this tissue, we aimed to analyze the state of the dopaminergic amacrine cells and some of their main post‐synaptic neurons in the retina of PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we evaluated morphology, number, and synaptic connections of dopaminergic cells and their post‐synaptic cells, AII amacrine and melanopsin‐containing retinal ganglion cells, in control and PD eyes from human donors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PD, dopaminergic amacrine cell number was reduced between 58% and 26% in different retinal regions, involving a decline in the number of synaptic contacts with AII amacrine cells (by 60%) and melanopsin cells (by 35%). Despite losing their main synaptic input, AII cells were not reduced in number, but they showed cellular alterations compromising their adequate function: i) a loss of mitochondria inside their lobular appendages, that may indicate an energetic failure and ii) a loss of connexin 36, suggesting alterations in the AII coupling and in visual signal transmission from the rod pathway.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dopaminergic system impairment and the affection of the rod pathway through the AII cells may explain and be partially responsible for the reduced contrast sensitivity or electroretinographic response described in PD. Also, dopamine reduction and the loss of synaptic contacts with melanopsin cells may contribute to the melanopsin retinal ganglion cell loss previously described and to the disturbances in circadian rhythm and sleep reported in PD patients. These data support the idea that the retina reproduces brain neurodegeneration and is highly involved in PD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Association of Plasma Neurofilament Light with Postoperative Delirium</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25889?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25889?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the association of plasma neuroaxonal injury markers neurofilament light (NfL), total tau, glial fibrillary acid protein and ubiquitin carboxyl‐terminal esterase l1 and delirium, delirium severity, and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delirium case‐no delirium control (n=108) pairs were matched by age, sex, surgery type, cognition, and vascular comorbidities. Biomarkers were measured in plasma collected preoperative(PREOP), 2 days(POD2) and 30 days postoperative(PO1MO) using Simoa technology (Quanterix). The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and CAM‐S(severity) was used to measure delirium and delirium severity, respectively. Cognitive function was measured with General Cognitive Performance(GCP) scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delirium cases had higher NfL on POD2 and PO1MO (median matched pair difference 16.2pg/ml and 13.6pg/ml, respectively (P &amp;lt; .05)). Patients with PREOP and POD2 NfL in the highest quartile (Q4) had increased risk for incident delirium (adjusted OR= 3.7(95% CI,1.1‐12.6), and 4.6(1.2‐18.2), respectively) and experienced more severe delirium, with sum CAM‐S scores 7.8 points (95%CI,1.6, 14.0), and 9.3 points higher (95%CI, 3.2, 15.5). At PO1MO, delirium cases had continued high NFL (adjusted OR of 9.7; 95% CI,2.3,41.4), and those with Q4 NfL values showed ‐2.3 point decline on GCP score (‐2.3 points, 95% CI, ‐4.7, ‐0.9).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with highest PREOP or POD2 NfL levels were more likely to develop delirium. Elevated NfL at PO1MO was associated with delirium and greater cognitive decline. These findings suggest NfL may be useful as a predictive biomarker for delirium risk and long‐term cognitive decline, and once confirmed would provide pathophysiological evidence for neuroaxonal injury following delirium.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans have long been fascinated by how memories are formed, how they can be
damaged or lost, or still seem vibrant after many years. Thus the search for
the locus and organization of memory has had a long history, in which the
notion that is is composed of distinct systems developed during the second half
of the 20th century. A fundamental dichotomy between conscious and unconscious
memory processes was first drawn based on evidences from the study of amnesiac
subjects and the systematic experimental work with animals. The use of
behavioral and neural measures together with imaging techniques have
progressively led researchers to agree in the existence of a variety of neural
architectures that support multiple memory systems. This article presents a
historical lens with which to contextualize these idea on memory systems, and
provides a current account for the multiple memory systems model.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Fast Immune System Inspired Hypermutation Operators for Combinatorial Optimisation. (arXiv:2009.00990v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00990</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00990</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Various studies have shown that immune system inspired hypermutation
operators can allow artificial immune systems (AIS) to be very efficient at
escaping local optima of multimodal optimisation problems. However, this
efficiency comes at the expense of considerably slower runtimes during the
exploitation phase compared to standard evolutionary algorithms. We propose
modifications to the traditional `hypermutations with mutation potential' (HMP)
that allow them to be efficient at exploitation as well as maintaining their
effective explorative characteristics. Rather than deterministically evaluating
fitness after each bit-flip of a hypermutation, we sample the fitness function
stochastically with a `parabolic' distribution which allows the `stop at first
constructive mutation' (FCM) variant of HMP to reduce the linear amount of
wasted function evaluations when no improvement is found to a constant. The
stochastic distribution also allows the removal of the FCM mechanism altogether
as originally desired in the design of the HMP operators. We rigorously prove
the effectiveness of the proposed operators for all the benchmark functions
where the performance of HMP is rigorously understood in the literature and
validating the gained insights to show linear speed-ups for the identification
of high quality approximate solutions to classical NP-Hard problems from
combinatorial optimisation. We then show the superiority of the HMP operators
to the traditional ones in an analysis of the complete standard Opt-IA AIS,
where the stochastic evaluation scheme allows HMP and ageing operators to work
in harmony. Through a comparative performance study of other `fast mutation'
operators from the literature, we conclude that a power-law distribution for
the parabolic evaluation scheme is the best compromise in black box scenarios
where little problem knowledge is available.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00945</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00945</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multivariate time series forecasting is of great importance to many
scientific disciplines and industrial sectors. The evolution of a multivariate
time series depends on the dynamics of its variables and the connectivity
network of causal interrelationships among them. Most of the existing time
series models do not account for the causal effects among the system's
variables and even if they do they rely just on determining the
between-variables causality network. Knowing the structure of such a complex
network and even more specifically knowing the exact lagged variables that
contribute to the underlying process is crucial for the task of multivariate
time series forecasting. The latter is a rather unexplored source of
information to leverage. In this direction, here a novel neural network-based
architecture is proposed, termed LAgged VAriable Representation NETwork
(LAVARNET), which intrinsically estimates the importance of lagged variables
and combines high dimensional latent representations of them to predict future
values of time series. Our model is compared with other baseline and state of
the art neural network architectures on one simulated data set and four real
data sets from meteorology, music, solar activity, and finance areas. The
proposed architecture outperforms the competitive architectures in most of the
experiments.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Online system identification is the estimation of parameters of a dynamical
system, such as mass or friction coefficients, for each measurement of the
input and output signals. Here, the nonlinear stochastic differential equation
of a Duffing oscillator is cast to a generative model and dynamical parameters
are inferred using variational message passing on a factor graph of the model.
The approach is validated with an experiment on data from an electronic
implementation of a Duffing oscillator. The proposed inference procedure
performs as well as offline prediction error minimisation in a state-of-the-art
nonlinear model.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modern biomedical, behavioral and psychological inference about cause-effect
relationships respects an ergodic assumption, that is, that mean response of
representative samples allow predictions about individual members of those
samples. Recent empirical evidence in all of the same fields indicates
systematic violations of the ergodic assumption. Indeed, violation of
ergodicity in biomedical, behavioral and psychological causes is precisely the
inspiration behind our research inquiry. Here, we review the long term costs to
scientific progress in these domains and a practical way forward. Specifically,
we advocate the use of statistical measures that can themselves encode the
degree and type of non-ergodicity in measurements. Taking such steps will lead
to a paradigm shift, allowing researchers to investigate the nonstationary,
far-from-equilibrium processes that characterize the creativity and emergence
of biological and psychological behavior.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Operational vs Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Denoising. (arXiv:2009.00612v1 [eess.IV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00612</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00612</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently become a favored technique
for image denoising due to its adaptive learning ability, especially with a
deep configuration. However, their efficacy is inherently limited owing to
their homogenous network formation with the unique use of linear convolution.
In this study, we propose a heterogeneous network model which allows greater
flexibility for embedding additional non-linearity at the core of the data
transformation. To this end, we propose the idea of an operational neuron or
Operational Neural Networks (ONN), which enables a flexible non-linear and
heterogeneous configuration employing both inter and intra-layer neuronal
diversity. Furthermore, we propose a robust operator search strategy inspired
by the Hebbian theory, called the Synaptic Plasticity Monitoring (SPM) which
can make data-driven choices for non-linearities in any architecture. An
extensive set of comparative evaluations of ONNs and CNNs over two severe image
denoising problems yield conclusive evidence that ONNs enriched by non-linear
operators can achieve a superior denoising performance against CNNs with both
equivalent and well-known deep configurations.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11234</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The notion of memory capacity, originally introduced for echo state and
linear networks with independent inputs, is generalized to nonlinear recurrent
networks with stationary but dependent inputs. The presence of dependence in
the inputs makes natural the introduction of the network forecasting capacity,
that measures the possibility of forecasting time series values using network
states. Generic bounds for memory and forecasting capacities are formulated in
terms of the number of neurons of the nonlinear recurrent network and the
autocovariance function or the spectral density of the input. These bounds
generalize well-known estimates in the literature to a dependent inputs setup.
Finally, for the particular case of linear recurrent networks with independent
inputs it is proved that the memory capacity is given by the rank of the
associated controllability matrix, a fact that has been for a long time assumed
to be true without proof by the community.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce and study a new model of interacting neural networks,
incorporating the spatial dimension (e.g. position of neurons across the
cortex) and some learning processes. The dynamic of each neural network is
described via the elapsed time model, that is, the neurons are described by the
elapsed time since their last discharge and the chosen learning processes are
essentially inspired from the Hebbian rule. We then obtain a system of
integro-differential equations, from which we analyze the convergence to
stationary states by the means of entropy method and Doeblin's theory in the
case of weak interconnections. We also consider the situation where neural
activity is faster than the learning process and give conditions where one can
approximate the dynamics by a solution with a similar profile of a steady
state. For stronger interconnections, we present some numerical simulations to
observe how the parameters of the system can give different behaviors and
pattern formations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary optimization is a generic population-based metaheuristic that
can be adapted to solve a wide variety of optimization problems and has proven
very effective for combinatorial optimization problems. However, the potential
of this metaheuristic has not been utilized in Distributed Constraint
Optimization Problems (DCOPs), a well-known class of combinatorial optimization
problems prevalent in Multi-Agent Systems. In this paper, we present a novel
population-based algorithm, Anytime Evolutionary DCOP (AED), that uses
evolutionary optimization to solve DCOPs. In AED, the agents cooperatively
construct an initial set of random solutions and gradually improve them through
a new mechanism that considers an optimistic approximation of local benefits.
Moreover, we present a new anytime update mechanism for AED that identifies the
best among a distributed set of candidate solutions and notifies all the agents
when a new best is found. In our theoretical analysis, we prove that AED is
anytime. Finally, we present empirical results indicating AED outperforms the
state-of-the-art DCOP algorithms in terms of solution quality.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Regional Differences in Penetration of the Protein Stabilizer Trimethoprim (TMP) in the Rat Central Nervous System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00167</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Regulating gene expression at the protein level is becoming increasingly important for answering basic questions in neurobiology. Several techniques using destabilizing domains (DD) on transgenes, which can be activated or deactivated by specific drugs, have been developed to achieve this goal. A DD from bacterial dihydrofolate reductase bound and stabilized by trimethoprim (TMP) represents such a tool. To control transgenic protein levels in the brain, the DD-regulating drugs need to have sufficient penetration into the central nervous system (CNS). Yet, very limited information is available on TMP pharmacokinetics in the CNS following systemic injection. Here, we performed a pharmacokinetic study on the penetration of TMP into different CNS compartments in the rat. We used mass spectrometry to measure TMP concentrations in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tissue samples of different CNS regions upon intraperitoneal TMP injection. We show that TMP quickly (within 10 min) penetrates from serum to CSF through the blood-CSF barrier. TMP also shows quick penetration into brain tissue but concentrations were an order of magnitude lower compared to serum or CSF. TMP concentration in spinal cord was lower than in any other analyzed CNS area. Nevertheless, effective levels of TMP to stabilize DDs can be reached in the CNS with half-lives around 2 h. These data show that TMP has good and fast penetration properties into the CNS and is therefore a valuable ligand for precisely controlling protein expression in the CNS in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Machine Learning Methods for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) Based Label-Free Detection of Microglia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00931</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automated computational analysis techniques utilizing machine learning have been demonstrated to be able to extract more data from different imaging modalities compared to traditional analysis techniques. One new approach is to use machine learning techniques to existing multiphoton imaging modalities to better interpret intrinsically fluorescent cellular signals to characterize different cell types. Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) is a high-resolution quantitative imaging tool that can detect metabolic cellular signatures based on the lifetime variations of intrinsically fluorescent metabolic co-factors such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NAD(P)H]. NAD(P)H lifetime-based discrimination techniques have previously been used to develop metabolic cell signatures for diverse cell types including immune cells such as macrophages. However, FLIM could be even more effective in characterizing cell types if machine learning was used to classify cells by utilizing FLIM parameters for classification. Here, we demonstrate the potential for FLIM-based, label-free NAD(P)H imaging to distinguish different cell types using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based machine learning. For our biological use case, we used the challenge of differentiating microglia from other glia cell types in the brain. Microglia are the resident macrophages of the brain and spinal cord and play a critical role in maintaining the neural environment and responding to injury. Microglia are challenging to identify as most fluorescent labeling approaches cross-react with other immune cell types, are often insensitive to activation state, and require the use of multiple specialized antibody labels. Furthermore, the use of these extrinsic antibody labels prevents application in in vivo animal models and possible future clinical adaptations such as neurodegenerative pathologies. With the ANN-based NAD(P)H FLIM analysis approach, we found that microglia in cell culture mixed with other glial cells can be identified with more than 0.9 True Positive Rate (TPR). We also extended our approach to identify microglia in fixed brain tissue with a TPR of 0.79. In both cases the False Discovery Rate was around 30%. This method can be further extended to potentially study and better understand microglia’s role in neurodegenerative disease with improved detection accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excitotoxicity is classically attributed to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through NMDA receptors (NMDAr), leading to production of nitric oxide by neuronal nitric oxide synthase and superoxide by mitochondria, which react to form highly cytotoxic peroxynitrite. More recent observations warrant revision of the classic view and help to explain some otherwise puzzling aspects of excitotoxic cell injury. Studies using pharmacological and genetic approaches show that superoxide produced by NMDAr activation originates primarily from NADPH oxidase rather than from mitochondria. As NADPH oxidase is localized to the plasma membrane, this also provides an explanation for the extracellular release of superoxide and cell-to-cell “spread” of excitotoxic injury observed in vitro and in vivo. The signaling pathway linking NMDAr to NADPH oxidase involves Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, phosphoinositol-3-kinase, and protein kinase Cζ, and interventions at any of these steps can prevent superoxide production and excitotoxic injury. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx specifically through NMDAr is normally required to induce excitotoxicity, through a mechanism presumed to involve privileged Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; access to local signaling domains. However, experiments using selective blockade of the NMDAr ion channel and artificial reconstitution of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by other routes indicate that the special effects of NMDAr activation are attributable instead to concurrent non-ionotropic NMDAr signaling by agonist binding to NMDAr. The non-ionotropic signaling driving NADPH oxidase activation is mediated in part by phosphoinositol-3-kinase binding to the C-terminal domain of GluN2B receptor subunits. These more recently identified aspects of excitotoxicity expand our appreciation of the complexity of excitotoxic processes and suggest novel approaches for limiting neuronal injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Abnormal Serum Bilirubin/Albumin Concentrations in Dementia Patients With Aβ Deposition and the Benefit of Intravenous Albumin Infusion for Alzheimer’s Disease Treatment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00859</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Our previous study in animal models revealed that bilirubin could induce Aβ formation and deposition. Bilirubin may be important in neurodegenerative dementia with Aβ deposition. Hence, lowering the concentration of the free bilirubin capable of crossing the blood brain–barrier may benefit the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;The objectives of this study were to examine the change in the serum bilirubin and albumin concentrations of dementia patients with Aβ deposition, and to determine the effects of intravenous administration of albumin in the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Bilirubin and albumin concentrations in dementia patients with Aβ deposition were examined. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined in dopaminergic neuron-like cells MN9D treated with bilirubin in the presence of diverse concentrations of serum. Human albumin at a dose of 10 g every 2 weeks for 24 weeks was administered intravenously to AD patients to examine the effect of albumin on AD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significantly higher indirect bilirubin (IBIL) concentrations, lower albumin concentrations, and higher ratio of IBIL to albumin (IBIL/ALB) were observed in dementia patients with Aβ deposition, including AD, dementia with Lewy bodies, and general paresis of insane. In vitro assays showed that bilirubin-induced injury in cultured dopaminergic neuron-like cells negatively depends on the concentration of serum in the culture medium. General linear model with repeated measures analysis indicated a main effect of group on the change in albumin concentrations and Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory scale (ADCS-ADL) scores, and the main effect of time and group, and group-by-time interaction on the change of Clinical Dementia Rating Scale–Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores. Analysis of the combined data of the entire 28 weeks of assessment period using the area under curve convincingly showed significantly improvements in the change of albumin concentrations, ADCS-ADL scores, and CDR-SB scores.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;IBIL and the IBIL/ALB ratio are significantly higher in dementia patients with Aβ deposition, and intravenous administration of albumin is beneficial to AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;The intervention study was registered at http://www.chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR-IOR-17011539). Date of registration: June 1, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Racial Differences in Dietary Relations to Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer’s Disease Risk: Do We Know Enough?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00359</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00359</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The elderly population in the US is increasing and projected to be 44% minority by 2060. African Americans and Hispanics are at increased risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease compared to non-Hispanic whites. These conditions are associated with many other adverse health outcomes, lower quality of life, and substantial economic burden. In the past few decades, diet has been identified as an important modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. Some studies report poor diet quality among African American and Hispanic older adult populations compared to their white counterparts. We have a limited understanding of how diet affects brain health in different racial-ethnic groups. One primary reason for our lack of knowledge is that most cohort studies are of majority non-Hispanic white participants. Moreover, those that do include minority participants do not publish their findings stratified by racial-ethnic groups, and likely have a less accurate measurement of dietary intake among minority groups. In this review, we summarize the current, albeit limited, literature on racial/ethnic differences in dietary relations to dementia outcomes. We will also discuss methodological issues in conducting nutrition studies in diverse cultures, and suggestions for future research directions. Overcoming the gaps will make it possible to make dietary recommendations for Alzheimer’s prevention that are more relevant for different racial/ethnic groups and set us on a faster track to reduce health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Network Modularity Predicts Improvements in Cognitive and Scholastic Performance in Children Involved in a Physical Activity Intervention</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00346</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00346</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Brain network modularity is a principle that quantifies the degree to which functional brain networks are divided into subnetworks. Higher modularity reflects a greater number of within-module connections and fewer connections between modules, and a highly modular brain is often interpreted as a brain that contains highly specialized brain networks with less integration between networks. Recent work in younger and older adults has demonstrated that individual differences in brain network modularity at baseline can predict improvements in performance after cognitive and physical interventions. The use of brain network modularity as a predictor of training outcomes has not yet been examined in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: In the present study, we examined the relationship between baseline brain network modularity and changes (post-intervention performance minus pre-intervention performance) in cognitive and academic performance in 8- to 9-year-old children who participated in an after-school physical activity intervention for 9 months (N = 78) as well as in children in a wait-list control group (N = 72).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In children involved in the after-school physical activity intervention, higher modularity of brain networks at baseline predicted greater improvements in cognitive performance for tasks of executive function, cognitive efficiency, and mathematics achievement. There were no associations between baseline brain network modularity and performance changes in the wait-list control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Our study has implications for biomarkers of cognitive plasticity in children. Understanding predictors of cognitive performance and academic progress during child development may facilitate the effectiveness of interventions aimed to improve cognitive and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Processes While Struggling With Evidence Accumulation During Facial Emotion Recognition: An ERP Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00340</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00340</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is tuned to recognize emotional facial expressions in faces having a natural upright orientation. The relative contributions of featural, configural, and holistic processing to decision-making are as yet poorly understood. This study used a diffusion decision model (DDM) of decision-making to investigate the contribution of early face-sensitive processes to emotion recognition from physiognomic features (the eyes, nose, and mouth) by determining how experimental conditions tapping those processes affect early face-sensitive neuroelectric reflections (P100, N170, and P250) of processes determining evidence accumulation at the behavioral level. We first examined the effects of both stimulus orientation (upright vs. inverted) and stimulus type (photographs vs. sketches) on behavior and neuroelectric components (amplitude and latency). Then, we explored the sources of variance common to the experimental effects on event-related potentials (ERPs) and the DDM parameters. Several results suggest that the N170 indicates core visual processing for emotion recognition decision-making: (a) the additive effect of stimulus inversion and impoverishment on N170 latency; and (b) multivariate analysis suggesting that N170 neuroelectric activity must be increased to counteract the detrimental effects of face inversion on drift rate and of stimulus impoverishment on the stimulus encoding component of non-decision times. Overall, our results show that emotion recognition is still possible even with degraded stimulation, but at a neurocognitive cost, reflecting the extent to which our brain struggles to accumulate sensory evidence of a given emotion. Accordingly, we theorize that: (a) the P100 neural generator would provide a holistic frame of reference to the face percept through categorical encoding; (b) the N170 neural generator would maintain the structural cohesiveness of the subtle configural variations in facial expressions across our experimental manipulations through coordinate encoding of the facial features; and (c) building on the previous configural processing, the neurons generating the P250 would be responsible for a normalization process adapting to the facial features to match the stimulus to internal representations of emotional expressions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Excitation-Inhibition Balanced Neural Networks for Fast Signal Detection</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excitation-inhibition (E-I) balanced neural networks are a classic model for modeling neural activities and functions in the cortex. The present study investigates the potential application of E-I balanced neural networks for fast signal detection in brain-inspired computation. We first theoretically analyze the response property of an E-I balanced network, and find that the asynchronous firing state of the network generates an optimal noise structure enabling the network to track input changes rapidly. We then extend the homogeneous connectivity of an E-I balanced neural network to include local neuronal connections, so that the network can still achieve fast response and meanwhile maintain spatial information in the face of spatially heterogeneous signal. Finally, we carry out simulations to demonstrate that our model works well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: On the Right Track to Treat Movement Disorders: Promising Therapeutic Approaches for Parkinson’s and Huntington’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.571185</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Movement disorders are neurological conditions in which patients manifest a diverse range of movement impairments. Distinct structures within the basal ganglia of the brain, an area involved in movement regulation, are differentially affected for every disease. Among the most studied movement disorder conditions are Parkinson’s (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD), in which the deregulation of the movement circuitry due to the loss of specific neuronal populations in basal ganglia is the underlying cause of motor symptoms. These symptoms are due to the loss principally of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) par compacta and the GABAergic neurons of the striatum in PD and HD, respectively. Although these diseases were described in the 19th century, no effective treatment can slow down, reverse, or stop disease progression. Available pharmacological therapies have been focused on preventing or alleviating motor symptoms to improve the quality of life of patients, but these drugs are not able to mitigate the progressive neurodegeneration. Currently, considerable therapeutic advances have been achieved seeking a more efficacious and durable therapeutic effect. Here, we will focus on the new advances of several therapeutic approaches for PD and HD, starting with the available pharmacological treatments to alleviate the motor symptoms in both diseases. Then, we describe therapeutic strategies that aim to restore specific neuronal populations or their activity. Among the discussed strategies, the use of Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) and genetic approaches to prevent the neuronal loss in these diseases will be described. We will highlight strategies that have been evaluated in both Parkinson’s and Huntington’s patients, and also the ones with strong preclinical evidence. These current therapeutic techniques represent the most promising tools for the safe treatment of both diseases, specifically those aimed to avoid neuronal loss during disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Redox Post-translational Modifications of Protein Thiols in Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative Conditions—Focus on S-Nitrosation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species (RONS) are by-products of aerobic metabolism. RONS trigger a signaling cascade that can be transduced through oxidation-reduction (redox)-based post-translational modifications (redox PTMs) of protein thiols. This redox signaling is essential for normal cellular physiology and coordinately regulates the function of redox-sensitive proteins. It plays a particularly important role in the brain, which is a major producer of RONS. Aberrant redox PTMs of protein thiols can impair protein function and are associated with several diseases. This mini review article aims to evaluate the role of redox PTMs of protein thiols, in particular S-nitrosation, in brain aging, and in neurodegenerative diseases. It also discusses the potential of using redox-based therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of the heat-activated cation channel TRPM3 alleviates inflammatory heat hyperalgesia, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We induced unilateral inflammation of the hind paw in mice, and directly compared expression and function of TRPM3 and two other heat-activated TRP channels (TRPV1 and TRPA1) in sensory neurons innervating the ipsilateral and contralateral paw. We detected increased &lt;i&gt;Trpm3&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels in dorsal root ganglion neurons innervating the inflamed paw, and augmented TRP channel-mediated calcium responses, both in the cell bodies and the intact peripheral endings of nociceptors. In particular, inflammation provoked a pronounced increase in nociceptors with functional co-expression of TRPM3, TRPV1 and TRPA1. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of TRPM3 dampened TRPV1- and TRPA1-mediated responses in nociceptors innervating the inflamed paw, but not in those innervating healthy tissue. These insights into the mechanisms underlying inflammatory heat hypersensitivity provide a rationale for developing TRPM3 antagonists to treat pathological pain.</description>

	<description>Understanding the causal processes that contribute to disease onset and progression is essential for developing novel therapies. Although &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-acting expression quantitative trait loci (&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-eQTLs) can directly reveal cellular processes modulated by disease variants, detecting &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-eQTLs remains challenging due to their small effect sizes. Here, we analysed gene expression and genotype data from six blood cell types from 226 to 710 individuals. We used co-expression modules inferred from gene expression data with five methods as traits in &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-eQTL analysis to limit multiple testing and improve interpretability. In addition to replicating three established associations, we discovered a novel &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-eQTL near &lt;i&gt;SLC39A8&lt;/i&gt; regulating a module of metallothionein genes in LPS-stimulated monocytes. Interestingly, this effect was mediated by a transient &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-eQTL present only in early LPS response and lost before the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; effect appeared. Our analyses highlight how co-expression combined with functional enrichment analysis improves the identification and prioritisation of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-eQTLs when applied to emerging cell-type-specific datasets.</description>

	<description>The neural circuits responsible for animal behavior remain largely unknown. We summarize new methods and present the circuitry of a large fraction of the brain of the fruit fly &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Improved methods include new procedures to prepare, image, align, segment, find synapses in, and proofread such large data sets. We define cell types, refine computational compartments, and provide an exhaustive atlas of cell examples and types, many of them novel. We provide detailed circuits consisting of neurons and their chemical synapses for most of the central brain. We make the data public and simplify access, reducing the effort needed to answer circuit questions, and provide procedures linking the neurons defined by our analysis with genetic reagents. Biologically, we examine distributions of connection strengths, neural motifs on different scales, electrical consequences of compartmentalization, and evidence that maximizing packing density is an important criterion in the evolution of the fly's brain.</description>

	<title>eLife: Repurposing of KLF5 activates a cell cycle signature during the progression from a precursor state to Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57189</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57189</link>
	<description>Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) is one of the most common causes of cancer deaths. Barrett's oesophagus (BO) is the only known precancerous precursor to OAC, but our understanding about the molecular events leading to OAC development is limited. Here, we have integrated gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles of human biopsies and identified a strong cell cycle gene expression signature in OAC compared to BO. Through analysing associated chromatin accessibility changes, we have implicated the transcription factor KLF5 in the transition from BO to OAC. Importantly, we show that KLF5 expression is unchanged during this transition, but instead, KLF5 is redistributed across chromatin to directly regulate cell cycle genes specifically in OAC cells. This new KLF5 target gene programme has potential prognostic significance as high levels correlate with poorer patient survival. Thus, the repurposing of KLF5 for novel regulatory activity in OAC provides new insights into the mechanisms behind disease progression.</description>

	<description>The asymmetric outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria functions as a selective permeability barrier to the environment. Perturbations to OM lipid asymmetry sensitize the cell to antibiotics. As such, mechanisms involved in lipid asymmetry are fundamental to our understanding of OM lipid homeostasis. One such mechanism, the Maintenance of lipid asymmetry (Mla) pathway has been proposed to extract mislocalized glycerophospholipids from the outer leaflet of the OM and return them to the inner membrane (IM). Work on this pathway in &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; support conflicting models for the directionality of the Mla system being retrograde (OM to IM) or anterograde (IM to OM). Here we show conclusively that &lt;i&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;mla&lt;/i&gt; mutants exhibit no defects in anterograde transport. Furthermore, we identify an allele of the GTPase &lt;i&gt;obgE&lt;/i&gt; that is synthetically sick in the absence of Mla; providing another link between cell envelope homeostasis and stringent response.</description>

	<title>eLife: The visual pigment xenopsin is widespread in protostome eyes and impacts the view on eye evolution</title>

	<description>Photoreceptor cells in the eyes of Bilateria are often classified into microvillar cells with rhabdomeric opsin and ciliary cells with ciliary opsin, each type having specialized molecular components and physiology. First data on the recently discovered xenopsin point towards a more complex situation in protostomes. In this study, we provide clear evidence that xenopsin enters cilia in the eye of the larval bryozoan &lt;i&gt;Tricellaria inopinata&lt;/i&gt; and triggers phototaxis. As reported from a mollusc, we find xenopsin coexpressed with rhabdomeric-opsin in eye photoreceptor cells bearing both microvilli and cilia in larva of the annelid &lt;i&gt;Malacoceros fuliginosus&lt;/i&gt;. This is the first organism known to have both xenopsin and ciliary opsin, showing that these opsins are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Compiling existing data, we propose that xenopsin may play an important role in many protostome eyes and provides new insights into the function, evolution, and possible plasticity of animal eye photoreceptor cells.</description>

	<description>To predict the tropism of human coronaviruses, we profile 28 SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus-associated receptors and factors (SCARFs) using single-cell transcriptomics across various healthy human tissues. SCARFs include cellular factors both facilitating and restricting viral entry. Intestinal goblet cells, enterocytes and kidney proximal tubule cells appear highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with clinical data.

The majority of neurons in primary visual cortex respond selectively to bars of light that have a specific orientation and move in a specific direction. The spatial and temporal responses of such neurons are non-separable. How neurons accomplish that computational feat without resort to explicit time delays is unknown. We propose a novel neural mechanism whereby visual cortex computes non-separable responses by generating endogenous traveling waves of neural activity that resonate with the space-time signature of the visual stimulus. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the response are defined by the local topology of excitatory and inhibitory lateral connections in the cortex. We simulated the interaction between endogenous traveling waves and the visual stimulus using spatially distributed populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with Wilson-Cowan dynamics and inhibitory-surround coupling. Our model reliably detected visual gratings that moved with a given speed and direction provided that we incorporated neural competition to suppress false motion signals in the opposite direction. The findings suggest that endogenous traveling waves in visual cortex can impart direction-selectivity on neural responses without resort to explicit time delays. They also suggest a functional role for motion opponency in eliminating false motion signals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rHG78oa3r3g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Tubulin dimers associate longitudinally and laterally to form metastable microtubules (MTs). MT disassembly is preceded by subtle structural changes in tubulin fueled by GTP hydrolysis. These changes render the MT lattice unstable, but it is unclear exactly how they affect lattice energetics and strain. We performed long-time atomistic simulations to interrogate the impacts of GTP hydrolysis on tubulin lattice conformation, lateral inter-dimer interactions, and (non-)local lateral coordination of dimer motions. The simulations suggest that most of the hydrolysis energy is stored in the lattice in the form of longitudinal strain. While not significantly affecting lateral bond stability, the stored elastic energy results in more strongly confined and correlated dynamics of GDP-tubulins, thereby entropically destabilizing the MT lattice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aDbDvM1xyZA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Brain of the African wild dog. I. Anatomy, architecture, and volumetrics&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6676331a-09be-4052-8678-c1333480fd3e/cne24999-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photograph of the lateral surface of the African wild dog brain. The African wild dog has a relatively large brain, but this appears to be related to a reduction in body mass during its evolutionary history, rather than an increase in brain mass in response to a complex social environment. In this image dorsal is to the top and rostral toward the left. Scale bar = 1 cm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The African wild dog is endemic to sub‐Saharan Africa and belongs to the family Canidae which includes domestic dogs and their closest relatives (i.e., wolves, coyotes, jackals, dingoes, and foxes). The African wild dog is known for its highly social behavior, co‐ordinated pack predation, and striking vocal repertoire, but little is known about its brain and whether it differs in any significant way from that of other canids. We employed gross anatomical observation, magnetic resonance imaging, and classical neuroanatomical staining to provide a broad overview of the structure of the African wild dog brain. Our results reveal a mean brain mass of 154.08 g, with an encephalization quotient of 1.73, indicating that the African wild dog has a relatively large brain size. Analysis of the various structures that comprise their brains and their topological inter‐relationships, as well as the areas and volumes of the corpus callosum, ventricular system, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and the gyrification index, all reveal that the African wild dog brain is, in general, similar to that of other mammals, and very similar to that of other carnivorans. While at this level of analysis we do not find any striking specializations within the brain of the African wild dog, apart from a relatively large brain size, the observations made indicate that more detailed analyses of specific neural systems, particularly those involved in sensorimotor processing, sociality or cognition, may reveal features that are either unique to this species or shared among the Canidae to the exclusion of other Carnivora.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Dendritic spine abnormalities correlate with behavioral and cognitive deficits in mouse models of Lafora disease</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Dendritic spine abnormalities correlate with behavioral and cognitive deficits in mouse models of Lafora disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0e3512bf-4f28-471d-8c5b-64916260f95f/cne25006-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known to associate with cognitive dysfunctions in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in the mouse model for Lafora disease (LD)—a fatal form of epileptic disorder associated with cognitive defects. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines from the postnatal period onwards. These animals also exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and nonspatial memory. Thus, dendritic spine abnormalities appear to be a primary developmental defect in the LD mouse model and may contribute to the cognitive deficits in the disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lafora disease (LD) is a genetic and fatal form of neurodegenerative disorder characterized by myoclonic epilepsy and cognitive deficits. LD is caused by loss‐of‐function mutations in the &lt;i&gt;EPM2A&lt;/i&gt; or the &lt;i&gt;NHLRC1&lt;/i&gt; gene. A major hallmark of LD is the presence of abnormal glycogen aggregates in neurons and other tissues. Functional studies on the genes have, therefore, mostly focused on glycogen metabolism. The physiological basis of cognitive deficits in LD is thus largely unexplored. Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We, therefore, analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal and Cortical layer V of the &lt;i&gt;Epm2a&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Nhlrc1&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice brain. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines in Postnatal day 21 to 12‐month‐old LD animals. Similar observations were made in the primary cultures of neurons derived from the hippocampi of the embryonic brain, suggesting that the aberrant spine phenotype could be a developmental defect in LD. We also looked at the cognitive and behavioral deficits as a possible readout of the spine abnormalities. The LD animals exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and nonspatial memory. Such abnormalities were seen in the younger (1–2 months) as well as the older (7–8 months) age groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the dendritic spine abnormalities are primary developmental defects in the LD model and these defects might underlie some of the symptoms, including cognitive deficits, in LD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine interferes with neuroblast proliferation and promotes apoptotic cell death in the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine interferes with neuroblast proliferation and promotes apoptotic cell death in the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/47d0975d-38f6-44b3-b57d-bf1a199d3946/cne25005-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study reveals that low doses of BrdU (from 25 to 75 μg/g) have no deleterious effects on the development of the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium. Our results also denote that the BrdU injection at doses ranging from 100 to 300 μg/g alters neuroblasts proliferation and induces the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study was conducted to assess whether a single administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine (BrdU) interferes with cell proliferation and leads to the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum. BrdU effects across a wide range of doses (25–300 μg/g b.w.) were analyzed using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural procedures. The pregnant rats were injected with BrdU at embryonic day 13, and their fetuses were sacrificed from 5 to 35 hr after exposure. The quantification of several parameters such as the density of mitotic figures, and BrdU and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)‐reactive cells showed that, in comparison with the saline injected rats, the administration of BrdU impairs the proliferative behavior of neuroepithelial cells. The above‐mentioned parameters were significantly reduced in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The reduction was more evident using 200 μg/g b.w. The most severe effects were found with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The present findings also revealed that high doses of BrdU lead to the activation of apoptotic cellular events as evidenced by both terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‐end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry for active caspase‐3. In comparison with saline rats, many apoptotic cells were found in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The number of dying cells increased with 200 μg/g b.w. The most important number of apoptotic cells were observed in animals injected with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of neuroblasts at different stages of apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Heteromer formation between cannabinoid type 1 and dopamine type 2 receptors is altered by combination cannabinoid and antipsychotic treatments</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Heteromer formation between cannabinoid type 1 and dopamine type 2 receptors is altered by combination cannabinoid and antipsychotic treatments&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/591cb11c-97d3-40b6-99ce-805b289a8da2/jnr24716-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we identified cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)/dopamine type 2 (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) heteromers in the globus pallidus of C57BL/J male mice. We found that heteromer formation was differentially influenced by a cannabinoid agonist and different antipsychotics. These CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers were also functionally relevant to mouse movement and γ‐aminobutyric acid release in a neuronal cell culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor and the dopamine type 2 (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor are co‐localized on medium spiny neuron terminals in the globus pallidus where they modulate neural circuits involved in voluntary movement. Physical interactions between the two receptors have been shown to alter receptor signaling in cell culture. The objectives of the current study were to identify the presence of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers in the globus pallidus of C57BL/6J male mice, define how CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromer levels are altered following treatment with cannabinoids and/or antipsychotics, and determine if fluctuating levels of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers have functional consequences. Using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; proximity ligation assays, we observed CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers in the globus pallidus of C57BL/6J mice. The abundance of the heteromers increased following treatment with the nonselective cannabinoid receptor agonist, CP55,940. In contrast, treatment with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol reduced the number of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers, whereas the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine treatment had no effect. Co‐treatment with CP55,940 and haloperidol had similar effects to haloperidol alone, whereas co‐treatment with CP55,940 and olanzapine had similar effects to CP55,940. The observed changes were found to have functional consequences as the differential effects of haloperidol and olanzapine also applied to γ‐aminobutyric acid release in ST&lt;i&gt;Hdh&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;Q7/Q7&lt;/sup&gt; cells and motor function in C57BL/6J male mice. This work highlights the clinical relevance of co‐exposure to cannabinoids and different antipsychotics over acute and prolonged time periods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Deep 2-Dimensional Dynamical Spiking Neuronal Network for Temporal Encoding trained with STDP. (arXiv:2009.00581v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain is known to be a highly complex, asynchronous dynamical system that
is highly tailored to encode temporal information. However, recent deep
learning approaches to not take advantage of this temporal coding. Spiking
Neural Networks (SNNs) can be trained using biologically-realistic learning
mechanisms, and can have neuronal activation rules that are biologically
relevant. This type of network is also structured fundamentally around
accepting temporal information through a time-decaying voltage update, a kind
of input that current rate-encoding networks have difficulty with. Here we show
that a large, deep layered SNN with dynamical, chaotic activity mimicking the
mammalian cortex with biologically-inspired learning rules, such as STDP, is
capable of encoding information from temporal data. We argue that the
randomness inherent in the network weights allow the neurons to form groups
that encode the temporal data being inputted after self-organizing with STDP.
We aim to show that precise timing of input stimulus is critical in forming
synchronous neural groups in a layered network. We analyze the network in terms
of network entropy as a metric of information transfer. We hope to tackle two
problems at once: the creation of artificial temporal neural systems for
artificial intelligence, as well as solving coding mechanisms in the brain.

Here the authors show that this interaction predates the emergence of Cf-2, an R-gene that evolved in Solanum to co-opt an existing effector-target reaction and trigger resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/vlXSdmsbSAw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Beta Rebound as an Index of Temporal Integration of Somatosensory and Motor Signals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00063</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00063</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modulation of cortical beta rhythm (15–30 Hz) is present during preparation for and execution of voluntary movements as well as during somatosensory stimulation. A rebound in beta synchronization is observed after the end of voluntary movements as well as after somatosensory stimulation and is believed to describe the return to baseline of sensorimotor networks. However, the contribution of efferent and afferent signals to the beta rebound remains poorly understood. Here, we applied electrical median nerve stimulation (MNS) to the right side followed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the left primary motor cortex after either 15 or 25 ms. Because the afferent volley reaches the somatosensory cortex after about 20 ms, TMS on the motor cortex was either anticipating or following the cortical arrival of the peripheral stimulus. We show modulations in different beta sub-bands and in both hemispheres, following a pattern of greater resynchronization when motor signals are paired with a peripheral one. The beta rebound in the left hemisphere (stimulated) is modulated in its lower frequency range when TMS precedes the cortical arrival of the afferent volley. In the right hemisphere (unstimulated), instead, the increase is limited to higher beta frequencies when TMS is delivered after the arrival of the afferent signal. In general, we demonstrate that the temporal integration of afferent and efferent signals plays a key role in the genesis of the beta rebound and that these signals may be carried in parallel by different beta sub-bands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: EEG-Based Emotion Classification Using a Deep Neural Network and Sparse Autoencoder</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emotion classification based on brain–computer interface (BCI) systems is an appealing research topic. Recently, deep learning has been employed for the emotion classifications of BCI systems and compared to traditional classification methods improved results have been obtained. In this paper, a novel deep neural network is proposed for emotion classification using EEG systems, which combines the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) together. In the proposed network, the features extracted by the CNN are first sent to SAE for encoding and decoding. Then the data with reduced redundancy are used as the input features of a DNN for classification task. The public datasets of DEAP and SEED are used for testing. Experimental results show that the proposed network is more effective than conventional CNN methods on the emotion recognitions. For the DEAP dataset, the highest recognition accuracies of 89.49% and 92.86% are achieved for valence and arousal, respectively. For the SEED dataset, however, the best recognition accuracy reaches 96.77%. By combining the CNN, SAE, and DNN and training them separately, the proposed network is shown as an efficient method with a faster convergence than the conventional CNN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Epidural Electrical Stimulation: A Review of Plasticity Mechanisms That Are Hypothesized to Underlie Enhanced Recovery From Spinal Cord Injury With Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00163</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in life-long sensorimotor impairment. Spontaneous recovery from SCI is limited, as supraspinal fibers cannot spontaneously regenerate to form functional networks below the level of injury. Despite this, animal models and humans exhibit many motor behaviors indicative of recovery when electrical stimulation is applied epidurally to the dorsal aspect of the lumbar spinal cord. In 1976, epidural stimulation was introduced to alleviate spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis. Since then, epidural electrical stimulation (EES) has been demonstrated to improve voluntary mobility across the knee and/or ankle in several SCI patients, highlighting its utility in enhancing motor activation. The mechanisms that EES induces to drive these improvements in sensorimotor function remain largely unknown. In this review, we discuss several sensorimotor plasticity mechanisms that we hypothesize may enable epidural stimulation to promote recovery, including changes in local lumbar circuitry, propriospinal interneurons, and the internal model. Finally, we discuss genetic tools for afferent modulation as an emerging method to facilitate the search for the mechanisms of action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Myasthenia Gravis With Antibodies Against Muscle Specific Kinase: An Update on Clinical Features, Pathophysiology and Treatment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00159</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00159</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Muscle Specific Kinase myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG) is an autoimmune disease that impairs neuromuscular transmission leading to generalized muscle weakness. Compared to the more common myasthenia gravis with antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), MuSK-MG affects mainly the bulbar and respiratory muscles, with more frequent and severe myasthenic crises. Treatments are usually less effective with the need for prolonged, high doses of steroids and other immunosuppressants to control symptoms. Under physiological condition, MuSK regulates a phosphorylation cascade which is fundamental for the development and maintenance of postsynaptic AChR clusters at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Agrin, secreted by the motor nerve terminal into the synaptic cleft, binds to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) which activates MuSK. In MuSK-MG, monovalent MuSK-IgG4 autoantibodies block MuSK-LRP4 interaction preventing MuSK activation and leading to the dispersal of AChR clusters. Lower levels of divalent MuSK IgG1, 2, and 3 antibody subclasses are also present but their contribution to the pathogenesis of the disease remains controversial. This review aims to provide a detailed update on the epidemiological and clinical features of MuSK-MG, focusing on the pathophysiological mechanisms and the latest indications regarding the efficacy and safety of different treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Ultra-Endurance Associated With Moderate Exercise in Rats Induces Cerebellar Oxidative Stress and Impairs Reactive GFAP Isoform Profile</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ultra-endurance (UE) race has been associated with brain metabolic changes, but it is still unknown which regions are vulnerable. This study investigated whether high-volume training in rodents, even under moderate intensity, can induce cerebellar oxidative and inflammatory status. Forty-five adult rats were divided into six groups according to a training period, followed or not by an exhaustion test (ET) that simulated UE: control (C), control + ET (C-ET), moderate-volume (MV) training and MV-ET, high-volume training (HV) and HV-ET. The training period was 30 (MV) and 90 (HV) min/day, 5 times/week for 3 months as a continuous running on a treadmill at a maximum velocity of 12 m/min. After 24 h, the ET was performed at 50% maximum velocities up to the animals refused to run, and then serum lactate levels were evaluated. Serum and cerebellar homogenates were obtained 24 h after ET. Serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and corticosterone levels were assessed. Lipid peroxidation (LP), nitric oxide (NO), Interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and GFAP proteins, reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were quantified in the cerebellum. Serum lactate concentrations were lower in MV-ET (∼20%) and HV-ET (∼40%) compared to the C-ET group. CK and corticosterone levels were increased more than ∼ twofold by HV training compared to control. ET increased CK levels in MV-ET vs. MV group (P = 0.026). HV induced higher LP levels (∼40%), but an additive effect of ET was only seen in the MV-ET group (P = 0.02). SOD activity was higher in all trained groups vs. C and C-ET (P &amp;lt; 0.05). CAT activity, however, was intensified only in the MV group (P &amp;lt; 0.02). The 50 kDa GFAP levels were enhanced in C-ET and MV-ET vs. respective controls, while 42 kDa (∼40%) and 39 kDa (∼26%) isoform levels were reduced. In the HV-ET group, the 50 KDa isoform amount was reduced ∼40–60% compared to the other groups and the 39 KDa isoform, increased sevenfold. LDH levels, GSH/GSSG ratio, and NO production were not modified. ET elevated IL-1β levels in the CT and MV groups. Data shows that cerebellar resilience to oxidative damage may be maintained under moderate-volume training, but it is reduced by UE running. High-volume training per se provoked systemic metabolic changes, cerebellar lipid peroxidation, and unbalanced enzymatic antioxidant resource. UE after high-volume training modified the GFAP isoform profile suggesting impaired astrocyte reactivity in the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disease based on four-repeat tauopathy pathology. Currently, this entity is not fully recognized in the context of pathogenesis or clinical examination. This review evaluates the association between neuroinflammation and microglial activation with the induction of pathological cascades that result in tauopathy pathology and the clinical manifestation of PSP. Multidimensional analysis was performed by evaluating genetic, biochemical, and neuroimaging biomarkers to determine whether neurodegeneration as an effect of neuroinflammation or neuroinflammation is a consequence of neurodegeneration in PSP. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first to investigate PSP in this context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Influence of Different EEG References on Scalp EEG Functional Network Analysis During Hand Movement Tasks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although scalp EEG functional networks have been applied to the study of motor tasks using electroencephalography (EEG), the selection of a suitable reference electrode has not been sufficiently researched. To investigate the effects of the original reference (REF-CZ), the common average reference (CAR), and the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) on scalp EEG functional network analysis during hand movement tasks, EEGs of 17 right-handed subjects performing self-paced hand movements were collected, and scalp functional networks [coherence (COH), phase-locking value (PLV), phase lag index (PLI)] with different references were constructed. Compared with the REF-CZ reference, the networks with CAR and REST references exhibited more significant increases in connectivity during the left-/right-hand movement preparation (MP) and movement execution (ME) stages. The node degree of the channel near the reference electrode was significantly reduced by the REF-CZ reference. CAR and REST both decreased this reference effect, REST more so than CAR. We confirmed that the choice of reference would affect the analysis of the functional network during hand movement tasks, and the REST reference can greatly reduce the effects of the online recording reference on the analysis of EEG connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Activity Reveals Multiple Motor-Learning Mechanisms in a Real-World Task</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many recent studies found signatures of motor learning in neural beta oscillations (13–30 Hz), and specifically in the post-movement beta rebound (PMBR). All these studies were in controlled laboratory-tasks in which the task designed to induce the studied learning mechanism. Interestingly, these studies reported opposing dynamics of the PMBR magnitude over learning for the error-based and reward-based tasks (increase vs. decrease, respectively). Here, we explored the PMBR dynamics during real-world motor-skill-learning in a billiards task using mobile-brain-imaging. Our EEG recordings highlight the opposing dynamics of PMBR magnitudes (increase vs. decrease) between different subjects performing the same task. The groups of subjects, defined by their neural dynamics, also showed behavioral differences expected for different learning mechanisms. Our results suggest that when faced with the complexity of the real-world different subjects might use different learning mechanisms for the same complex task. We speculate that all subjects combine multi-modal mechanisms of learning, but different subjects have different predominant learning mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Awareness and Stimulus-Driven Spatial Attention as Independent Processes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00352</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00352</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To investigate the relation between attention and awareness, we manipulated visibility/awareness and stimulus-driven attention capture among metacontrast-masked visual stimuli. By varying the time interval between target and mask, we manipulated target visibility measured as target discrimination accuracies (ACCs; Experiments 1 and 2) and as subjective awareness ratings (Experiment 3). To modulate stimulus-driven attention capture, we presented the masked target either as a color-singleton (the target stands out by its unique color among homogeneously colored non-singletons), as a non-singleton together with a distractor singleton elsewhere (an irrelevant distractor has a unique color, whereas the target is colored like the other stimuli) or without a singleton (no stimulus stands out; only in Experiment 1). As color singletons capture attention in a stimulus-driven way, we expected target visibility/discrimination performance to be best for target singletons and worst with distractor singletons. In Experiments 1 and 2, we confirmed that the masking interval and the singleton manipulation influenced ACCs in an independent way and that attention capture by the singletons, with facilitated performance in target-singleton compared to distractor-singleton conditions, was found regardless of the interval-induced (in-)visibility of the targets. In Experiment 1, we also confirmed that attention capture was the same among participants with worse and better visibility/discrimination performance. In Experiment 2, we confirmed attention capture by color singletons with better discrimination performance for probes presented at singleton position, compared to other positions. Finally, in Experiment 3, we found that attention capture by target singletons also increased target awareness and that this capture effect on subjective awareness was independent of the effect of the masking interval, too. Together, results provide new evidence that stimulus-driven attention and awareness operate independently from one another and that stimulus-driven attention capture can precede awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: RNA Binding Protein Motif 3 Inhibits Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation-Induced Apoptosis Through Promoting Stress Granules Formation in PC12 Cells and Rat Primary Cortical Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As a sensitive cold-shock protein, RNA binding protein motif 3 (RBM3) exhibits a neuroprotective function in the condition of brain injury. However, how RBM3 is involved in acute ischemic stroke by affecting stress granules (SGs) remains unclear. Here, we established an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in rat primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells to explore the potential mechanism between RBM3 and SG formation in acute ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) condition. The immunofluorescence results showed that the SG formation significantly decreased in rat primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells during the reperfusion period after 6 h of OGD stimulation. The western blot results, flow cytometry analysis, and cell viability assessment showed that the RBM3 expression and ratio of cell viability significantly decreased, while the rate of apoptosis increased in PC12 cells during the reperfusion period after 6 h of OGD stimulation. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and immunofluorescence indicated that RBM3 and GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) colocalized cytoplasm of PC12 cells after 6 h of OGD stimulation when the SGs formation reached the highest level. Besides, overexpression and knockdown of the RBM3 were achieved via plasmid transfection and CRISPR-Cas9 technology, respectively. The results of overexpression and knockdown of RBM3 gene illustrated the pivotal role of RBM3 in affecting SG formation and apoptosis level in OGD-treated PC12 cells. In conclusion, RBM3 could combine with G3BP1 resulted in increasing stress granules generation in rat primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells after 6 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury, which ultimately reduced the apoptosis in OGD-induced cells. Our study may enable a new promising target for alleviating ischemia-reperfusion injury in cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inhibition of Brd4 by JQ1 Promotes Functional Recovery From Spinal Cord Injury by Activating Autophagy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a destructive neurological disorder that is characterized by impaired sensory and motor function. Inhibition of bromodomain protein 4 (Brd4) has been shown to promote the maintenance of cell homeostasis by activating autophagy. However, the role of Brd4 inhibition in SCI and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Thus, the goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of sustained Brd4 inhibition using the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitor JQ1 on the regulation of apoptosis, oxidative stress and autophagy in a mouse model of SCI. First, we observed that Brd4 expression at the lesion sites of mouse spinal cords increased after SCI. Treatment with JQ1 significantly decreased the expression of Brd4 and improved functional recovery for up to 28 day after SCI. In addition, JQ1-mediated inhibition of Brd4 reduced oxidative stress and inhibited the expression of apoptotic proteins to promote neural survival. Our results also revealed that JQ1 treatment activated autophagy and restored autophagic flux, while the positive effects of JQ1 were abrogated by autophagy inhibitor 3-MA intervention, indicating that autophagy plays a crucial role in therapeutic effects Brd4 induced by inhibition of the functional recovery SCI. In the mechanistic analysis, we observed that modulation of the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 pathway is involved in the activation of autophagy mediated by Brd4 inhibition. Taken together, the results of our investigation provides compelling evidence that Brd4 inhibition by JQ1 promotes functional recovery after SCI and that Brd4 may serve as a potential target for SCI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the majority of schizophrenia patients, chronic atypical antipsychotic administration produces a significant reduction in or even complete remission of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. However, these drugs are not effective in improving cognitive and emotional deficits in patients with schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have a high affinity for the dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor, and a modest affinity for the serotonin 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. The cognitive and emotional deficits in schizophrenia are thought to involve neural networks beyond the classical dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, however, including serotonergic systems. For example, mutations in the RELN gene, which encodes Reelin, an extracellular matrix protein involved in neural development and synaptic plasticity, are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, hippocampal Reelin levels are down-regulated in the brains of both schizophrenic patients and in rodent models of schizophrenia. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Reelin microinjection into the mouse hippocampus on behavioral phenotypes to evaluate the role of Reelin in neurodevelopmental disorders and to test a therapeutic approach that extends beyond classical monoamine targets. To model the cognitive and emotional deficits, as well as histological decreases in Reelin-positive cell numbers and hippocampal synaptoporin distribution, a synaptic vesicle protein, offspring that were prenatally exposed to maternal immune activation were used. Microinjections of recombinant Reelin protein into the hippocampus rescued impairments in object memory and anxiety-like behavior and recruited synaptoporin in the hippocampus in offspring exposed to antenatal inflammation. These results suggest that Reelin supplementation has the potential to treat cognitive and emotional impairments, as well as synaptic disturbances, in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Synaptic Organizers in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Classification Based on Amyloid-β Sensitivity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic pathology is one of the major hallmarks observed from the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), leading to cognitive and memory impairment characteristic of AD patients. Synaptic connectivity and specificity are regulated by multiple trans-bindings between pre- and post-synaptic organizers, the complex of which exerts synaptogenic activity. Neurexins (NRXs) and Leukocyte common antigen-related receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) are the major presynaptic organizers promoting synaptogenesis through their distinct binding to a wide array of postsynaptic organizers. Recent studies have shown that amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs), a major detrimental molecule in AD, interact with NRXs and neuroligin-1, an NRX-binding postsynaptic organizer, to cause synaptic impairment. On the other hand, LAR-RPTPs and their postsynaptic binding partners have no interaction with AβOs, and their synaptogenic activity is maintained even in the presence of AβOs. Here, we review the current evidence regarding the involvement of synaptic organizers in AD, with a focus on Aβ synaptic pathology, to propose a new classification where NRX-based and LAR-RPTP-based synaptic organizing complexes are classified into Aβ-sensitive and Aβ-insensitive synaptic organizers, respectively. We further discuss how their different Aβ sensitivity is involved in Aβ vulnerability and tolerance of synapses for exploring potential therapeutic approaches for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Protective Effects of Hydrogen Sulfide Against the ATP-Induced Meningeal Nociception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00266</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00266</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We previously showed that extracellular ATP and hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), a recently discovered gasotransmitter, are both triggering the nociceptive firing in trigeminal nociceptors implicated in migraine pain. ATP contributes to meningeal nociception by activating the P2X3 subunit-containing receptors whereas H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S operates mainly via TRP receptors. However, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S was also proposed as a neuroprotective and anti-nociceptive agent. This study aimed to test the effect of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S on ATP-mediated nociceptive responses in rat meningeal afferents and trigeminal neurons and on ATP-induced degranulation of dural mast cells. Electrophysiological recording of trigeminal nerve activity in meninges was supplemented by patch-clamp and calcium imaging studies of isolated trigeminal neurons. The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S donor NaHS induced a mild activation of afferents and fully suppressed the subsequent ATP-induced firing of meningeal trigeminal nerve fibers. This anti-nociceptive effect of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S was specific as an even stronger effect of capsaicin did not abolish the action of ATP. In isolated trigeminal neurons, NaHS decreased the inward currents and calcium transients evoked by activation of ATP-gated P2X3 receptors. Moreover, NaHS prevented ATP-induced P2X7 receptor-mediated degranulation of meningeal mast cells which emerged as triggers of migraine pain. Finally, NaHS decreased the concentration of extracellular ATP in the meningeal preparation. Thus, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S exerted the multiple protective actions against the nociceptive effects of ATP. These data highlight the novel pathways to reduce purinergic mechanisms of migraine with pharmacological donors or by stimulation production of endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Multiple Origins of Secretagogin Expressing Cortical GABAergic Neuron Precursors in the Early Human Fetal Telencephalon</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00061</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00061</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Secretagogin (SCGN) which acts as a calcium signaling sensor, has previously been shown to be expressed by a substantial population of cortical GABAergic neurons at mid-gestation in humans but not in mice. The present study traced SCGN expression in cortical GABAergic neurons in human fetal forebrain from earlier stages than previously studied. Multiple potential origins of SCGN-expressing neurons were identified in the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) septum and preoptic area; these cells largely co-expressed SP8 but not the medial ganglionic eminence marker LHX6. They followed various migration routes to reach their target regions in the neocortex, insular and olfactory cortex (OC) and olfactory bulbs. A robust increase in the number of SCGN-expressing GABAergic cortical neurons was observed in the midgestational period; 58% of DLX2+ neurons expressed SCGN in the cortical wall at 19 post-conceptional weeks (PCW), a higher proportion than expressed calretinin, a marker for GABAergic neurons of LGE/CGE origin. Furthermore, although most SCGN+ neurons co-expressed calretinin in the cortical plate (CP) and deeper layers, in the marginal zone (MZ) SCGN+ and calretinin+ cells formed separate populations. In the adult mouse, it has previously been shown that in the rostral migratory stream (RMS), SCGN, annexin V (ANXA5), and matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) are co-expressed forming a functioning complex that exocytoses MMP2 in response to calcium. In the present study, ANXA5 showed widespread expression throughout the cortical wall, although MMP2 expression was very largely limited to the CP. We found co-expression of these proteins in some SCGN+ neurons in the subventricular zones (SVZ) suggesting a limited role for these cells in remodeling the extracellular matrix, perhaps during cell migration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dietary Diversity Is Associated With Memory Status in Chinese Adults: A Prospective Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.580760</guid>

	<description>Background and Aim&lt;p&gt;Subjective memory complaints are common in elderly people. Nutrition plays an important role in keeping brain health, however, the evidence on dietary diversity and subjective memory status is limited. This study aimed to investigate the effect of dietary diversity score (DDS) on memory status in Chinese adults in a prospective cohort study.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Data of the China Health and Nutrition Survey was used in this study. A total of 4356 participants aged 50 years or older were enrolled in the analysis. DDS was calculated based on the dietary recall data collected in the wave of 2011. Information on self-report memory status (OK, good, or bad) and memory change in the past 12 months (stayed the same, improved, or deteriorated) were obtained from the wave of 2015. A memory score was calculated based on a subset of items of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations of DDS with memory status and memory change, and linear regression models were carried out to estimate the association between DDS and memory score.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the study population, the percentages of participants who thought their memory was OK, bad, and good were 43.3, 24.3, and 32.4%, respectively. There were 1.4% of participants reported memory improvement in the past 12 months and 47.2% reported memory decline. Average memory score among participants was 12.8 ± 6.1. Compared with participants who thought their memory was OK, a higher DDS was associated with self-reported good memory (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.15, 95%CI 1.07–1.24) and inversely associated with bad memory (OR 0.82, 95%CI 0.75–0.89). In subgroup analysis, however, in participants aged 65 years and above, the association between DDS and self-reported good memory was insignificant (OR 1.09, 95%CI 0.94–1.25). Compared with participants whose memory stayed the same, higher DDS was inversely associated with memory decline (OR 0.85, 95%CI 0.80–0.91). Besides, higher DDS was associated with higher memory score (β 0.74, 95%CI 0.56–0.91).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study revealed that higher DDS was associated with better memory status and was inversely associated with self-reported memory decline in Chinese adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Structural Neural Correlates of Double Decision Performance in Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00278</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Speed of processing is a cognitive domain that encompasses the speed at which an individual can perceive a given stimulus, interpret the information, and produce a correct response. Speed of processing has been shown to decline more rapidly than other cognitive domains in an aging population, suggesting that this domain is particularly vulnerable to cognitive aging (Chee et al., 2009). However, given the heterogeneity of neuropsychological measures used to assess the domains underpinning speed of processing, a diffuse pattern of brain regions has been implicated. The current study aims to investigate the structural neural correlates of speed of processing by assessing cortical volume and speed of processing scores on the POSIT Double Decision task within a healthy older adult population (N = 186; mean age = 71.70 ± 5.32 years). T1-weighted structural images were collected via a 3T Siemens scanner. The current study shows that less cortical thickness in right temporal, posterior frontal, parietal and occipital lobe structures were significantly associated with poorer Double Decision scores. Notably, these include the lateral orbitofrontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, superior, transverse, and inferior temporal gyrus, temporal pole, insula, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, superior and inferior parietal gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus. Such findings suggest that speed of processing performance is associated with a wide array of cortical regions that provide unique contributions to performance on the Double Decision task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A Cross-species Model of Dual-Task Walking in Young and Older Humans and Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00276</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00276</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Dual-task walking is common in daily life but becomes more difficult with aging. Little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms affecting competing cognitive demands. Translational studies with human and animal models are needed to address this gap. This pilot study investigated the feasibility of implementing a novel cross-species dual-task model in humans and rats and aimed to establish preliminary evidence that the model induces a dual-task cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Young and older humans and rats performed an object discrimination task (OD), a baseline task of typical walking (baseline), an alternation turning task on a Figure 8 walking course (Alt), and a dual-task combining object discrimination with the alternation task (AltOD). Primary behavioral assessments including walking speed and correct selections for object discrimination and turning direction. In humans, left prefrontal cortex activity was measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Human subjects generally performed well on all tasks, but the older adults exhibited a trend for a slowing of walking speed immediately before the turning decision for Alt and AltOD compared to baseline. Older adults also had heightened prefrontal activity relative to young adults for the Alt and AltOD tasks. Older rodents required more training than young rodents to learn the alternation task. When tested on AltOD with and without a 15-s delay between trials, older rodents exhibited a substantial performance deficit for the delayed version on the initial day of testing. Old rats, however, did not show a significant slowing in walking speed with increasing task demand, as was evident in the young rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: This study demonstrates the feasibility and challenges associated with implementing a cross-species dual-task model. While there was preliminary evidence of dual-task cost in both humans and rats, the magnitude of effects was small and not consistent across species. This is likely due to the relative ease of each task in humans and the walking component in rats not being sufficiently challenging. Future versions of this test should make the cognitive tasks more challenging and the motor task in rats more complex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Bridging the Gap Between Fluid Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease, Model Systems, and Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00272</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of two proteins in fibrillar form: amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau. Despite decades of intensive research, we cannot yet pinpoint the exact cause of the disease or unequivocally determine the exact mechanism(s) underlying its progression. This confounds early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, which can reveal ongoing biochemical changes in the brain, can help monitor developing AD pathology prior to clinical diagnosis. Here we review preclinical and clinical investigations of commonly used biomarkers in animals and patients with AD, which can bridge translation from model systems into the clinic. The core AD biomarkers have been found to translate well across species, whereas biomarkers of neuroinflammation translate to a lesser extent. Nevertheless, there is no absolute equivalence between biomarkers in human AD patients and those examined in preclinical models in terms of revealing key pathological hallmarks of the disease. In this review, we provide an overview of current but also novel AD biomarkers and how they relate to key constituents of the pathological cascade, highlighting confounding factors and pitfalls in interpretation, and also provide recommendations for standardized procedures during sample collection to enhance the translational validity of preclinical AD models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Clinically Precedented Protein Kinases: Rationale for Their Use in Neurodegenerative Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Kinases are an intensively studied drug target class in current pharmacological research as evidenced by the large number of kinase inhibitors being assessed in clinical trials. Kinase-targeted therapies have potential for treatment of a broad array of indications including central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In addition to the many variables which contribute to identification of a successful therapeutic molecule, drug discovery for CNS-related disorders also requires significant consideration of access to the target organ and specifically crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To date, only a small number of kinase inhibitors have been reported that are specifically designed to be BBB permeable, which nonetheless demonstrates the potential for success. This review considers the potential for kinase inhibitors in the context of unmet medical need for neurodegenerative disease. A subset of kinases that have been the focus of clinical investigations over a 10-year period have been identified and discussed individually. For each kinase target, the data underpinning the validity of each in the context of neurodegenerative disease is critically evaluated. Selected molecules for each kinase are identified with information on modality, binding site and CNS penetrance, if known. Current clinical development in neurodegenerative disease are summarized. Collectively, the review indicates that kinase targets with sufficient rationale warrant careful design approaches with an emphasis on improving brain penetrance and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60743</link>
	<description>Human plasma contains &amp;gt;40,000 different coding and non-coding RNAs that are potential biomarkers for human diseases. Here, we used thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase sequencing (TGIRT-seq) combined with peak calling to simultaneously profile all RNA biotypes in apheresis-prepared human plasma pooled from healthy individuals. Extending previous TGIRT-seq analysis, we found that human plasma contains largely fragmented mRNAs from &amp;gt;19,000 protein-coding genes, abundant full-length, mature tRNAs and other structured small non-coding RNAs, and less abundant tRNA fragments and mature and pre-miRNAs. Many of the mRNA fragments identified by peak calling correspond to annotated protein-binding sites and/or have stable predicted secondary structures that could afford protection from plasma nucleases. Peak calling also identified novel repeat RNAs, miRNA-sized RNAs, and putatively structured intron RNAs of potential biological, evolutionary, and biomarker significance, including a family of full-length excised introns RNAs, subsets of which correspond to mirtron pre-miRNAs or agotrons.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cdon mutation and fetal alcohol converge on Nodal signaling in a mouse model of holoprosencephaly</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60351</link>
	<description>Holoprosencephaly (HPE), a defect in midline patterning of the forebrain and midface, arises ~1 in 250 conceptions. It is associated with predisposing mutations in the Nodal and Hedgehog (HH) pathways, with penetrance and expressivity graded by genetic and environmental modifiers, via poorly understood mechanisms. CDON is a multifunctional co-receptor, including for the HH pathway. In mice, &lt;i&gt;Cdon&lt;/i&gt; mutation synergizes with fetal alcohol exposure, producing HPE phenotypes closely resembling those seen in humans. We report here that, unexpectedly, Nodal signaling is a major point of synergistic interaction between &lt;i&gt;Cdon&lt;/i&gt; mutation and fetal alcohol. Window-of-sensitivity, genetic, and in vitro findings are consistent with a model whereby brief exposure of &lt;i&gt;Cdon&lt;/i&gt; mutant embryos to ethanol during gastrulation transiently and partially inhibits Nodal pathway activity, with consequent effects on midline patterning. These results illuminate mechanisms of gene-environment interaction in a multifactorial model of a common birth defect.</description>

	<description>Seasonal influenza virus A/H3N2 is a major cause of death globally. Vaccination remains the most effective preventative. Rapid mutation of hemagglutinin allows viruses to escape adaptive immunity. This antigenic drift necessitates regular vaccine updates. Effective vaccine strains need to represent H3N2 populations circulating one year after strain selection. Experts select strains based on experimental measurements of antigenic drift and predictions made by models from hemagglutinin sequences. We developed a novel influenza forecasting framework that integrates phenotypic measures of antigenic drift and functional constraint with previously published sequence-only fitness estimates. Forecasts informed by phenotypic measures of antigenic drift consistently outperformed previous sequence- only estimates, while sequence-only estimates of functional constraint surpassed more comprehensive experimentally-informed estimates. Importantly, the best models integrated estimates of both functional constraint and either antigenic drift phenotypes or recent population growth.</description>

	<title>eLife: Structural analysis of the Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm Type IV Secretion System Core Complex</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59530</link>
	<description>&lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila &lt;/i&gt;is an opportunistic pathogen that causes the potentially fatal pneumonia Legionnaires' Disease. This infection and subsequent pathology require the Dot/Icm Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) to deliver effector proteins into host cells. Compared to prototypical T4SSs, the Dot/Icm assembly is much larger, containing ~27 different components including a core complex reported to be composed of five proteins: DotC, DotD, DotF, DotG, and DotH. Using single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we report reconstructions of the core complex of the Dot/Icm T4SS that includes a symmetry mismatch between distinct structural features of the outer membrane cap (OMC) and periplasmic ring (PR). We present models of known core complex proteins, DotC, DotD, and DotH, and two structurally similar proteins within the core complex, DotK and Lpg0657. This analysis reveals the stoichiometry and contact interfaces between the key proteins of the Dot/Icm T4SS core complex and provides a framework for understanding a complex molecular machine.</description>

	<description>The pathogenesis of &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt;-associated gastric cancer is dependent on delivery of CagA into host cells through a type IV secretion system (T4SS). The &lt;i&gt;H. pylori&lt;/i&gt; Cag T4SS includes a large membrane-spanning core complex containing 5 proteins, organized into an outer membrane cap (OMC), a periplasmic ring (PR) and a stalk. Here, we report cryo-EM reconstructions of a core complex lacking Cag3 and an improved map of the wild-type complex. We define the structures of two unique species-specific components (Cag3 and CagM) and show that Cag3 is structurally similar to CagT. Unexpectedly, components of the OMC are organized in a 1:1:2:2:5 molar ratio (CagY:CagX:CagT:CagM:Cag3). CagX and CagY are components of both the OMC and the PR and bridge the symmetry mismatch between these regions. These results reveal that assembly of the &lt;i&gt;H. pylori&lt;/i&gt; T4SS core complex is dependent on incorporation of interwoven species-specific components.</description>

	<description>We demonstrate a combined experimental and computational approach for the quantitative characterization of lateral interactions between membrane-associated proteins. In particular, weak, lateral (cis) interactions between E-cadherin extracellular domains tethered to supported lipid bilayers, were studied using a combination of dynamic single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. Cadherins are intercellular adhesion proteins that assemble into clusters at cell-cell contacts through cis- and trans- (adhesive) interactions. A detailed and quantitative understanding of cis-clustering has been hindered by a lack of experimental approaches capable of detecting and quantifying lateral interactions between proteins on membranes. Here single-molecule intermolecular FRET measurements of wild-type E-cadherin and cis-interaction mutants combined with simulations demonstrate that both nonspecific and specific cis-interactions contribute to lateral clustering on lipid bilayers. Moreover, the intermolecular binding and dissociation rate constants are quantitatively and independently determined, demonstrating an approach that is generalizable for other interacting proteins.</description>

	<description>Outer radial glial (oRG) cells are a population of neural stem cells prevalent in the developing human cortex that contribute to its cellular diversity and evolutionary expansion. The mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is active in human oRG cells. Mutations in mTOR pathway genes are linked to a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders and malformations of cortical development. We find that dysregulation of mTOR signaling specifically affects oRG cells, but not other progenitor types, by changing the actin cytoskeleton through the activity of the Rho-GTPase, CDC42. These effects change oRG cellular morphology, migration, and mitotic behavior, but do not affect proliferation or cell fate. Thus, mTOR signaling can regulate the architecture of the developing human cortex by maintaining the cytoskeletal organization of oRG cells and the radial glia scaffold. Our study provides insight into how mTOR dysregulation may contribute to neurodevelopmental disease.</description>

	<title>eLife: Complement opsonization of HIV affects primary infection of human colorectal mucosa and subsequent activation of T cells</title>

	<description>HIV transmission via genital and colorectal mucosa are the most common routes of dissemination. Here, we explored the effects of free and complement-opsonized HIV on colorectal tissue. Initially, there was higher antiviral responses in the free HIV compared to complement-opsonized virus. The mucosal transcriptional response at 24h revealed the involvement of activated T cells, which was mirrored in cellular responses observed at 96h in isolated mucosal T cells. Further, HIV exposure led to skewing of T cell phenotypes predominantly to inflammatory CD4+ T cells, i.e. Th17 and Th1Th17 subsets. Of note, HIV exposure created an environment that altered the CD8+ T cell phenotype, e.g. expression of regulatory factors, especially when the virions were opsonized with complement factors. Our findings suggest that HIV-opsonization alters the activation and signaling pathways in the colorectal mucosa, which promotes viral establishment by creating an environment that stimulates mucosal T cell activation and inflammatory Th cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: Resource plasticity-driven carbon-nitrogen budgeting enables specialization and division of labor in a clonal community</title>

	<description>Previously, we found that in glucose-limited &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; colonies, metabolic constraints drive cells into groups exhibiting gluconeogenic or glycolytic states. In that study, threshold amounts of trehalose - a limiting, produced carbon-resource, controls the emergence and self-organization of cells exhibiting the glycolytic state, serving as a carbon source that fuels glycolysis (Varahan et al., 2019). We now discover that the plasticity of use of a non-limiting resource, aspartate, controls both resource production and the emergence of heterogeneous cell states, based on differential metabolic budgeting. In gluconeogenic cells, aspartate is a carbon source for trehalose production, while in glycolytic cells using trehalose for carbon, aspartate is predominantly a nitrogen source for nucleotide synthesis. This metabolic plasticity of aspartate enables carbon-nitrogen budgeting, thereby driving the biochemical self-organization of distinct cell states. Through this organization, cells in each state exhibit true division of labor, providing growth/survival advantages for the whole community.</description>

	<description>The primate amygdala performs multiple functions that may be related to the anatomical heterogeneity of its nuclei. Individual neurons with stimulus- and task-specific responses are not clustered in any of the nuclei, suggesting that single-units may be too-fine grained to shed light on the mesoscale organization of the amygdala. We have extracted from local field potentials recorded simultaneously from multiple locations within the primate (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) amygdala spatially defined and statistically separable responses to visual, tactile, and auditory stimuli. A generalized eigendecomposition-based method of source separation isolated coactivity patterns, or components, that in neurophysiological terms correspond to putative subnetworks. Some component spatial patterns mapped onto the anatomical organization of the amygdala, while other components reflected integration across nuclei. These components differentiated between visual, tactile, and auditory stimuli suggesting the presence of functionally distinct parallel subnetworks.</description>

	<description>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) are two highly infectious and lethal viruses causing major economic losses to pig production. Here, we report generation of double-gene-knockout (DKO) pigs harboring edited knockout alleles for known receptor proteins CD163 and pAPN and show that DKO pigs are completely resistant to genotype 2 PRRSV and TGEV. We found no differences in meat-production or reproductive-performance traits between wild-type and DKO pigs, but detected increased iron in DKO muscle. Additional infection challenge experiments showed that DKO pigs exhibited decreased susceptibility to porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), thus offering unprecedented in vivo evidence of pAPN as one of PDCoV receptors. Beyond showing that multiple gene edits can be combined in a livestock animal to achieve simultaneous resistance to two major viruses, our study introduces a valuable model for investigating infection mechanisms of porcine pathogenic viruses that exploit pAPN or CD163 for entry.</description>

	<description>Larval tracheae of Drosophila harbor progenitors of the adult tracheal system (tracheoblasts). We showed previously that thoracic tracheoblasts arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle in an ATR-Checkpoint Kinase1(Chk1)-dependent manner prior to division and morphogenesis (Kizhedathu et al., 2018). Here we investigate developmental regulation of Chk1 activation. We report that Wnt signaling is high in tracheoblasts and is necessary for high levels of activated (phosphorylated) Chk1. We find that canonical Wnt signaling facilitates this by transcriptional upregulation of Chk1 in cells that have ATR kinase activity. Wnt signalling is dependent on four Wnts (Wg, Wnt5, 6,10) that are expressed at high levels in arrested tracheoblasts and downregulated at mitotic re-entry. Interestingly, none of the Wnts are dispensable and act synergistically to induce Chk1. Finally, we show that downregulation of Wnt signalling and Chk1 expression leads to mitotic re-entry and the concomitant upregulation of Dpp signalling, driving tracheoblast proliferation.</description>

	<title>eLife: What do adversarial images tell us about human vision?</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55978</link>
	<description>Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are frequently described as the best current models of human and primate vision. An obvious challenge to this claim is the existence of &lt;i&gt;adversarial images&lt;/i&gt; that fool DCNNs but are uninterpretable to humans. However, recent research has suggested that there may be similarities in how humans and DCNNs interpret these seemingly nonsense images. We reanalysed data from a high-profile paper and conducted five experiments controlling for different ways in which these images can be generated and selected. We show human-DCNN agreement is much weaker and more variable than previously reported, and that the weak agreement is contingent on the choice of adversarial images and the design of the experiment. Indeed, we find there are well-known methods of generating images for which humans show no agreement with DCNNs. We conclude that adversarial images still pose a challenge to theorists using DCNNs as models of human vision.</description>

	<title>eLife: Ultra-high field imaging reveals increased whole brain connectivity underpins cognitive strategies that attenuate pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55028</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55028</link>
	<description>We investigated how the attenuation of pain with cognitive interventions affects brain connectivity using neuroimaging and a whole brain novel analysis approach. While receiving tonic cold pain, 20 healthy participants performed three different pain attenuation strategies during simultaneous collection of functional imaging data at 7 tesla. Participants were asked to rate their pain after each trial. We related the trial-by-trial variability of the attenuation performance to the trial-by-trial functional connectivity strength change of brain data. Across all conditions, we found that a higher performance of pain attenuation was predominantly associated with higher functional connectivity. Of note, we observed an association between low pain and high connectivity for regions that belong to brain regions long associated with pain processing, i.e. the insular and cingulate cortices. For one of the cognitive strategies (safe place), the performance of pain attenuation was explained by diffusion tensor imaging metrics of increased white matter integrity.</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive deficits due to spinal cord injury (SCI) have been elucidated in both animals and humans with SCI. Such disorders may cause concomitant oscillatory changes in regions of the brain involving in cognition; a subject that has not been directed mechanistically. One of the crucial oscillations, having a prominent role in cognition, particularly spatial memory, is hippocampal theta rhythm. Our research revealed that SCI could induce changes not only in the neurogenesis and apoptosis rate of the hippocampus but also in theta power as well as receptors involving in the generation of this rhythm. Herein we used 24 male Wistar rats (Sham/SCI = 12) and examined the effect of spinal cord contusion on hippocampal theta rhythm, spatial memory, and neurodegeneration. We proved that SCI eliminates hippocampus‐dependent theta power through spatial working memory, and correlates significantly with neurodegeneration and expression of receptors (NMDA, GABAA, Muscarinic1/M1), which are in turn essential in generation of theta rhythm. The immunohistochemistry analysis also demonstrated a significant decrease in DCX+ and BrdU+ cells; however, according to TUNEL assay, apoptosis is significantly higher in SCI‐induced animals. The western blotting analysis further showed a significant reduction of the abovementioned receptors in the hippocampus. We also verified that SCI impairs the spatial memory, proved by poor performance in the Y‐maze task. As well as, based on the local field potential recordings analysis, SCI decreases the power of theta rhythm. Eventually, this study demonstrated that chronic brain neurodegeneration occurs after SCI accompanied by theta rhythm and cognitive deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Locus Coeruleus and neurovascular unit: From its role in physiology to its potential role in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24718?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locus coeruleus (LC) is the main noradrenergic (NA) nucleus of the central nervous system. LC degenerates early during Alzheimer's disease (AD) and NA loss might concur to AD pathogenesis. Aside from neurons, LC terminals provide dense innervation of brain intraparenchymal arterioles/capillaries, and NA modulates astrocyte functions. The term neurovascular unit (NVU) defines the strict anatomical/functional interaction occurring between neurons, glial cells, and brain vessels. NVU plays a fundamental role in coupling the energy demand of activated brain regions with regional cerebral blood flow, it includes the blood–brain barrier (BBB), plays an active role in neuroinflammation, and participates also to the glymphatic system. NVU alteration is involved in AD pathophysiology through several mechanisms, mainly related to a relative oligoemia in activated brain regions and impairment of structural and functional BBB integrity, which contributes also to the intracerebral accumulation of insoluble amyloid. We review the existing data on the morphological features of LC‐NA innervation of the NVU, as well as its contribution to neurovascular coupling and BBB proper functioning. After introducing the main experimental data linking LC with AD, which have repeatedly shown a key role of neuroinflammation and increased amyloid plaque formation, we discuss the potential mechanisms by which the loss of NVU modulation by LC might contribute to AD pathogenesis. Surprisingly, thus far not so many studies have tested directly these mechanisms in models of AD in which LC has been lesioned experimentally. Clarifying the interaction of LC with NVU in AD pathogenesis may disclose potential therapeutic targets for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make optimal use of previous experiences, important neural activity sequences must be prioritized during hippocampal replay. Integrating insights about the interplay between CA3 and CA2, we propose a conceptual framework that allows the two regions to control which sequences are reactivated. We suggest that neuromodulatory‐gated plasticity and mutual inhibition enable discrete assembly sequences in both regions to support each other while suppressing competing sequences. This perspective provides a coherent interpretation for a variety of seemingly disconnected functional properties of CA2 and paves the way for a more general understanding of CA2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Progression of Basal Ganglia Pathology in Heterozygous Q175 Knock‐in Huntington's Disease Mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4765eb38-f95c-439a-bb11-9352c7149d15/cne25023-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striatal interneurons of cholinergic (ChAT+) striatal interneurons in WT and heterozygous Q175 mice at 18 months of age. The images show that striatal cholinergic interneuron abundance is comparable, but dendrites in Q175 mice are significantly fewer and shorter. These abnormalities and diverse striatal projection neuron abnormalities develop between 2 and 6 months of age in Q175 heterozygotes, indicating early effects of the HD mutation on the striatum in these mice that in many regards resemble those in human HD. Nonetheless, the pathologies do not yet involve overt striatal neuron loss even by 18 months, indicating they are less severe than even in premanifest HD.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used behavioral testing and morphological methods to detail the progression of basal ganglia neuron type‐specific pathology and the deficits stemming from them in male heterozygous Q175 mice, compared to age‐matched WT males. A rotarod deficit was not present in Q175 mice until 18 months, but increased open field turn rate (reflecting hyperkinesia) and open field anxiety were evident at 6 months. No loss of striatal neurons was seen out to 18 months, but ENK+ and DARPP32+ striatal perikarya were fewer by 6 months, due to diminished expression, with further decline by 18 months. No reduction in SP+ striatal perikarya or striatal interneurons was seen in Q175 mice at 18‐months, but cholinergic interneurons showed dendrite attenuation by 6 months. Despite reduced ENK expression in indirect pathway striatal perikarya, ENK‐immunostained terminals in globus pallidus externus (GPe) were more abundant at 6 months, and remained so out to 18 months. Similarly, SP‐immunostained terminals from striatal direct pathway neurons were more abundant in globus pallidus internus and substantia nigra at 6 months, and remained so at 18 months. FoxP2+ arkypallidal GPe neurons and subthalamic nucleus neurons were lost by 18 months but not prototypical PARV+ GPe neurons or dopaminergic nigral neurons. Our results show that striatal projection neuron abnormalities and behavioral abnormalities reflecting them develop between 2 and 6 months of age in Q175 male heterozygotes, indicating early effects of the HD mutation. The striatal pathologies resemble those in human HD, but are less severe at 18 months than even in premanifest HD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Development and migration of the zebrafish rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Development and migration of the zebrafish rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neurons&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d4981672-f412-45ac-8177-7f487ef16b51/cne25021-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we provide an overview of rhombencephalic octavolateral efferent neuron (OEN) development in the zebrafish. OENs are born in two groups: the rostral (REN) group is born in r4 with the facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs), while the caudal (CEN) group is born in r5. From there, the OENs migrate alongside the FBMNs to r6 and r7, where they cluster into bilateral nuclei. However, we identify several key differences between the mechanisms OENs and FBMNs use to migrate. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vertebrate animals, motor and sensory efferent neurons carry information from the central nervous system (CNS) to peripheral targets. These two types of efferent systems sometimes bear a close resemblance, sharing common segmental organization, axon pathways, and chemical messengers. Here, we focus on the development of the octavolateral efferent neurons (OENs) and their interactions with the closely‐related facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) in zebrafish. Using live‐imaging approaches, we investigate the birth, migration, and projection patterns of OENs. We find that OENs are born in two distinct groups: a group of rostral efferent neurons (RENs) that arises in the fourth segment, or rhombomere (r4), of the hindbrain and a group of caudal efferent neurons (CENs) that arises in r5. Both RENs and CENs then migrate posteriorly through the hindbrain between 18 and 48 hours post‐fertilization, alongside the r4‐derived FBMNs. Like the FBMNs, migration of the r4‐derived RENs depends on function of the segmental identity gene &lt;i&gt;hoxb1a&lt;/i&gt;; unlike the FBMNs, however, both OEN populations move independently of &lt;i&gt;prickle1b&lt;/i&gt;. Further, we investigate whether the previously described ‘pioneer’ neuron that leads FBMN migration through the hindbrain is an r4‐derived FBMN/REN or an r5‐derived CEN. Our experiments verify that the pioneer is an r4‐derived neuron and reaffirm its role in leading FBMN migration across the r4/5 border. In contrast, the r5‐derived CENs migrate independently of the pioneer. Together, these results indicate that the mechanisms OENs use to navigate the hindbrain differ significantly from those employed by FBMNs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Putative dendritic correlates of chronic traumatic encephalopathy: A preliminary quantitative Golgi exploration&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2c9eb7d1-d321-4f14-b61a-b08887e4c9cc/cne25022-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macroscopic gray matter changes have been well documented in in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The present study examined microscopic gray matter changes in CTE by comparing the dendritic arbors of supragranular pyramidal neurons from prefrontal and occipital cortices in both control and CTE cases. CTE neurons exhibited significantly lower mean dendritic measure values than did control neurons, while also displaying considerably greater variability across measures. These changes may be a newly‐described pathological marker of CTE, and could supplement current mechanistic and functional understandings of the disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with repetitive head impacts. Neuropathologically, it is defined by the presence of perivascular hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates in cortical tissue (McKee et al&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;, 2016). Although many pathological and assumed clinical correlates of CTE have been well‐characterized, its effects on cortical dendritic arbors are still unknown. Here, we quantified dendrites and dendritic spines of supragranular pyramidal neurons in tissue from human frontal and occipital lobes, in 11 cases with (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 79 ± 7 years) and five cases without (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 76 ± 11 years) CTE. Tissue was stained with a modified rapid Golgi technique. Dendritic systems of 20 neurons per region in each brain (N = 640 neurons) were quantified using computer‐assisted morphometry. One key finding was that CTE neurons exhibited increased variability and distributional changes across six of the eight dendritic system measures, presumably due to ongoing degeneration and compensatory reorganization of dendritic systems. However, despite heightened variation among CTE neurons, CTE cases exhibited lower mean values than control cases in seven of the eight dendritic system measures. These dendritic alterations may represent a new pathological marker of CTE, and further examination of dendritic changes could contribute to both mechanistic and functional understandings of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graph illustrating the heterogeneity within the meso‐diencephalic dopaminergic nuclei, in the proportion of cells immuno‐positive for tyrosine hydroxylase (&lt;b&gt;TH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) that expressed the vesicular glutamatergic transporter 2 (&lt;b&gt;Vglut2&lt;/b&gt;) during their lifetime according to a cell fate mapping strategy. Each dot illustrates the proportion measured from one mouse.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co‐transmission of glutamate by brain dopaminergic neurons was recently proposed as a potential factor influencing cell survival in models of Parkinson’s disease. Intriguingly, brain dopaminergic nuclei are differentially affected in Parkinson’s disease. Whether this is associated with different patterns of co‐expression of the glutamatergic phenotype along the rostro‐caudal brain axis is unknown in mammals. We hypothesized that, as in zebrafish, the glutamatergic phenotype is present preferentially in the caudal meso‐diencephalic dopaminergic nuclei. Here, we used in mice a cell fate mapping strategy based on reporter protein expression (ZsGreen) consecutive to previous expression of the &lt;i&gt;vesicular glutamate transporter 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt;) gene, coupled with immunofluorescence experiments against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or dopamine transporter (DAT). We found three expression patterns in DA cells, organized along the rostro‐caudal brain axis. The first pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐positive, ZsGreen‐positive) was found in A8‐A10. The second pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐negative, ZsGreen‐positive) was found in A11. The third pattern (TH‐positive, DAT‐negative, ZsGreen‐negative) was found in A12‐A13. These patterns should help to refine the establishment of the homology of dopaminergic nuclei between vertebrate species. Our results also uncover that &lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt; is expressed at some point during cell lifetime in dopaminergic nuclei known to degenerate in Parkinson's disease and largely absent from those that are preserved, suggesting that co‐expression of the glutamatergic phenotype in dopaminergic cells influences their survival in Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding proteomic changes in the ischemic penumbra are crucial to rescue those salvageable cells and reduce the damage of an ischemic stroke. Since the penumbra region is dynamic with heterogeneous cells/tissues, tissue sampling from animal models of stroke for the molecular study is a challenge. In this study, cultured hippocampal HT22 cells under hypoxia treatment for 17.5 h with 0.69 mM low glucose (H+LG) could mimic ischemic penumbral cells since they had much higher cell viability and viable cell number compared to hypoxia without glucose (H−G) treatment. To validate established cell-based ischemic penumbral model and understand the beneficial effects of low glucose (LG), quantitative proteomics analysis was performed on H+LG, H−G, and normoxia with normal 22 mM glucose (N+G) treated cells. We identified 427 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) between H−G and N+G and further identified 105 DAPs between H+LG and H−G. Analysis of 105 DAPs revealed that LG promotes cell survival by activating HIF1α to enhance glycolysis; preventing the dysregulations of extracellular matrix remodeling, cell cycle and division, and antioxidant and detoxification; as well as attenuating inflammatory reaction response, protein synthesis and neurotransmission activity. Our results demonstrated that this established cell-based system could mimic penumbral conditions and can be used for molecular studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Structural basis for the reaction cycle of DASS dicarboxylate transporters</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.61350</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61350</link>
	<description>Citrate, α-ketoglutarate and succinate are TCA cycle intermediates that also play essential roles in metabolic signaling and cellular regulation. These di- and tricarboxylates are imported into the cell by the divalent anion sodium symporter (DASS) family of plasma membrane transporters, which contains both cotransporters and exchangers. While DASS proteins transport substrates via an elevator mechanism, to date structures are only available for a single DASS cotransporter protein in a substrate-bound, inward-facing state. We report multiple cryo-EM and X-ray structures in four different states, including three hitherto unseen states, along with molecular dynamics simulations, of both a cotransporter and an exchanger. Comparison of these outward- and inward-facing structures reveal how the transport domain translates and rotates within the framework of the scaffold domain through the transport cycle. Additionally, we propose that DASS transporters ensure substrate coupling by a charge-compensation mechanism, and by structural changes upon substrate release.</description>

	<title>eLife: Ordered dephosphorylation initiated by the selective proteolysis of cyclin B drives mitotic exit</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59885</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59885</link>
	<description>APC/C-mediated proteolysis of cyclin B and securin promotes anaphase entry, inactivating CDK1 and permitting chromosome segregation, respectively. Reduction of CDK1 activity relieves inhibition of the CDK1-counteracting phosphatases PP1 and PP2A-B55, allowing wide-spread dephosphorylation of substrates. Meanwhile, continued APC/C activity promotes proteolysis of other mitotic regulators. Together, these activities orchestrate a complex series of events during mitotic exit. However, the relative importance of regulated proteolysis and dephosphorylation in dictating the order and timing of these events remains unclear. Using high temporal-resolution proteomics, we compare the relative extent of proteolysis and protein dephosphorylation. This reveals highly-selective rapid proteolysis of cyclin B, securin and geminin at the metaphase-anaphase transition, followed by slow proteolysis of other substrates. Dephosphorylation requires APC/C-dependent destruction of cyclin B and was resolved into PP1-dependent categories with unique sequence motifs. We conclude that dephosphorylation initiated by selective proteolysis of cyclin B drives the bulk of changes observed during mitotic exit.</description>

	<title>eLife: Behavioural diversity of bonobo prey preference as a potential cultural trait</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59191</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59191</link>
	<description>The importance of cultural processes to behavioural diversity in our closest living relatives is central to revealing the evolutionary origins of human culture. However, the bonobo is often overlooked as a candidate model. Further, a prominent critique to many examples of proposed animal cultures is premature exclusion of environmental confounds known to shape behavioural phenotypes. We addressed these gaps by investigating variation in prey preference between neighbouring bonobo groups that associate and overlap space use. We find group preference for duiker or anomalure hunting otherwise unexplained by variation in spatial usage, seasonality, or hunting party size, composition, and cohesion. Our findings demonstrate that group-specific behaviours emerge independently of the local ecology, indicating that hunting techniques in bonobos may be culturally transmitted. The tolerant intergroup relations of bonobos offer an ideal context to explore drivers of behavioural phenotypes, the essential investigations for phylogenetic constructs of the evolutionary origins of culture.</description>

	<description>A recent paper by Cong et al. provides exciting evidence that neurons contain proteins that protect synapses from complement-mediated synapse elimination. SRPX2 binds C1q and blocks microglial synapse engulfment. The findings point at SRPX2, and potentially other related sushi domain proteins, as possible targets for therapies for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.</description>

	<description>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized synapse that is the point of connection between motor neurons and skeletal muscle. Although developmental studies have established the importance of cell–cell communication at the NMJ for the integrity and full functionality of this synapse, the contribution of this structure as a primary driver in motor neuron disease pathogenesis remains uncertain. Here, we consider the biology of the NMJ and review emerging lines of investigation that are highlighting the importance of cell–cell interaction at the NMJ in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</description>

	<description>Asrican et al. demonstrate that stimulating endogenous CCK neuropeptide release in adult dentate gyrus supports neurogenic proliferation of rNSCs through a dominant astrocyte-mediated glutamatergic signaling cascade. In contrast, reducing dentate CCK induced reactive astrocytes, decreased neurogenic proliferation of rNSCs, and upregulated genes involved in neuroinflammation.</description>

	<description>Yamulla and colleagues perform combinatorial CRISPR mutagenesis of 20 genes commonly disrupted in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. They find combinations driving or enhancing efficient transformation of surface epithelium stem cells, with a core set being Tp53, Pten, and Rb1/Cdkn2a. Several genes either do not promote or inhibit transformation, including Brca2.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Computer-guided binding mode identification and affinity improvement of an LRR protein binder without structure determination</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoonjoo Choi, Sukyo Jeong, Jung-Min Choi, Christian Ndong, Karl E. Griswold, Chris Bailey-Kellogg, Hak-Sung Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Precise binding mode identification and subsequent affinity improvement without structure determination remain a challenge in the development of therapeutic proteins. However, relevant experimental techniques are generally quite costly, and purely computational methods have been unreliable. Here, we show that integrated computational and experimental epitope localization followed by full-atom energy minimization can yield an accurate complex model structure which ultimately enables effective affinity improvement and redesign of binding specificity. As proof-of-concept, we used a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein binder, called a repebody (Rb), that specifically recognizes human IgG&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (hIgG&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). We performed computationally-guided identification of the Rb:hIgG&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; binding mode and leveraged the resulting model to reengineer the Rb so as to significantly increase its binding affinity for hIgG&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as well as redesign its specificity toward multiple IgGs from other species. Experimental structure determination verified that our Rb:hIgG&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; model closely matched the co-crystal structure. Using a benchmark of other LRR protein complexes, we further demonstrated that the present approach may be broadly applicable to proteins undergoing relatively small conformational changes upon target binding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wzv2JsLh9jY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Estimating the risk of species interaction loss in mutualistic communities</title>

Interactions between species generate the functions on which ecosystems and humans depend. However, we lack an understanding of the risk that interaction loss poses to ecological communities. Here, we quantify the risk of interaction loss for 4,330 species interactions from 41 empirical pollination and seed dispersal networks across 6 continents. We estimate risk as a function of interaction vulnerability to extinction (likelihood of loss) and contribution to network feasibility, a measure of how much an interaction helps a community tolerate environmental perturbations. Remarkably, we find that more vulnerable interactions have higher contributions to network feasibility. Furthermore, interactions tend to have more similar vulnerability and contribution to feasibility across networks than expected by chance, suggesting that vulnerability and feasibility contribution may be intrinsic properties of interactions, rather than only a function of ecological context. These results may provide a starting point for prioritising interactions for conservation in species interaction networks in the future.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VUTxJ8X8-Rk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Spastin depletion increases tubulin polyglutamylation and impairs kinesin-mediated neuronal transport, leading to working and associative memory deficits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by André T. Lopes, Torben J. Hausrat, Frank F. Heisler, Kira V. Gromova, Franco L. Lombino, Timo Fischer, Laura Ruschkies, Petra Breiden, Edda Thies, Irm Hermans-Borgmeyer, Michaela Schweizer, Jürgen R. Schwarz, Christian Lohr, Matthias Kneussel&lt;/p&gt;

Mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-severing protein spastin (spastic paraplegia 4 [SPG4]) cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), associated with neurodegeneration, spasticity, and motor impairment. Complicated forms (complicated HSP [cHSP]) further include cognitive deficits and dementia; however, the etiology and dysfunctional mechanisms of cHSP have remained unknown. Here, we report specific working and associative memory deficits upon spastin depletion in mice. Loss of spastin-mediated severing leads to reduced synapse numbers, accompanied by lower miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequencies. At the subcellular level, mutant neurons are characterized by longer microtubules with increased tubulin polyglutamylation levels. Notably, these conditions reduce kinesin-microtubule binding, impair the processivity of kinesin family protein (KIF) 5, and reduce the delivery of presynaptic vesicles and postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Rescue experiments confirm the specificity of these results by showing that wild-type spastin, but not the severing-deficient and disease-associated K388R mutant, normalizes the effects at the synaptic, microtubule, and transport levels. In addition, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated reduction of tubulin polyglutamylation on spastin knockout background normalizes KIF5 transport deficits and attenuates the loss of excitatory synapses. Our data provide a mechanism that connects spastin dysfunction with the regulation of kinesin-mediated cargo transport, synapse integrity, and cognition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qIyNCUbD91s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sex Mediates Relationships Between Regional Tau Pathology and Cognitive Decline</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25878?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25878?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study was to examine sex differences in tau distribution across the brain of older adults, using positron emission tomography (PET), and investigate how these differences might associate with cognitive trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were 343 clinically normal individuals (women, 58%; 73.8 [8.5] years) and 55 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; women, 38%; 76.9 [7.3] years) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We examined &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐Flortaucipir (FTP)‐positron emission tomography (PET) signal across 41 cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs). Linear regression models estimated the effect of sex on FTP‐signal for each ROI after adjusting for age and cohort. We also examined interactions between sex*Aβ‐PET positive / negative (+ / −) and sex*apolipoprotein ε4 (APOEε4) status. Linear mixed models estimated the moderating effect of sex on the relationship between a composite of sex‐differentiated tau ROIs and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women showed significantly higher FTP‐signals than men across multiple regions of the cortical mantle (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.007). β‐amyloid (Aβ)‐moderated sex differences in tau signal were localized to medial and inferio‐lateral temporal regions (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.007); Aβ + women exhibited greater FTP‐signal than other groups. APOEε4‐moderated sex differences in FTP‐signal were only found in the lateral occipital lobe. Women with higher FTP‐signals in composite ROI exhibited faster cognitive decline than men (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tau vulnerability in women is not just limited to the medial temporal lobe and significantly contributed to greater risk of faster cognitive decline. Interactive effects of sex and Aβ were predominantly localized in the temporal lobe, however, sex differences in extra‐temporal tau highlights the possibility of accelerated tau proliferation in women with the onset of clinical symptomatology.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Non‐Motor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease are Reduced by Nabilone</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25864?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25864?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of nabilone, a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol analogue, as a treatment for non‐motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a phase II placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, parallel‐group, enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal trial conducted at the Medical University Innsbruck. A random sample of 47 patients with PD with stable motor disease and disturbing NMS defined by a score of ≥4 points on the Movement Disorder Society ‐ Unified PD Rating Scale‐I (MDS‐UPDRS‐I) underwent open‐label nabilone titration (0.25 mg once daily to 1 mg twice daily, phase I). Responders were randomized 1:1 to continue with nabilone or switch to placebo for 4 weeks (phase II). The primary efficacy criterion was the change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I between randomization and week 4. Safety was analyzed in all patients who received at least one nabilone dose.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between October 2017 and July 2019, 19 patients received either nabilone (median dose = 0.75 mg) or placebo. At week 4, mean change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I was 2.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 3.74, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, effect size = 1.15) in the placebo versus 1.00 (95% CI −0.16 to 2.16, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.280, effect size = 0.42) in the nabilone‐group (difference: 1.63, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.18, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.030, effect size = 0.66). Seventy‐seven percent of patients had adverse events (AEs) during open‐label titration, most of them were transient. In the double‐blind phase, similar proportions of patients in each group had AEs (42% in the placebo group and 32% in the nabilone group). There were no serious AEs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results highlight the potential efficacy of nabilone for patients with PD with disturbing NMS, which appears to be driven by positive effects on anxious mood and night‐time sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Possible routes of SARS‐CoV‐2 invasion in brain: In context of neurological symptoms in COVID‐19 patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24717?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24717?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manifestation of neurological symptoms in certain patients of coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) has warranted for their virus‐induced etiogenesis. SARS‐CoV‐2, the causative agent of COVID‐19, belongs to the genus of betacoronaviruses which also includes SARS‐CoV‐1 and MERS‐CoV; causative agents for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, respectively. Studies demonstrating the neural invasion of SARS‐CoV‐2 &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are still scarce, although such characteristics of certain other betacoronaviruses are well demonstrated in the literature. Based on the recent evidence for the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 host cell entry receptors in specific components of the human nervous and vascular tissue, a neural (olfactory and/or vagal), and a hematogenous—crossing the blood–brain barrier, routes have been proposed. The neurological symptoms in COVID‐19 may also arise as a consequence of the “cytokine storm” (characteristically present in severe disease) induced neuroinflammation, or co‐morbidities. There is also a possibility that, there may be multiple routes of SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into the brain, or multiple mechanisms can be involved in the pathogenesis of the neurological symptoms. In this review article, we have discussed the possible routes of SARS‐CoV‐2 brain entry based on the emerging evidence for this virus, and that available for other betacoronaviruses in literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sensitivity‐specificity of tau and Aβ PET in frontotemporal lobar degeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25893?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25893?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine associations between tau and amyloid‐beta (Aβ) molecular PET and both Alzheimer‐related pathology and 4‐repeat tau pathology in autopsy‐confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four patients had [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐Flortaucipir PET and died with FTLD (progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) n = 10, corticobasal degeneration (CBD) n = 10, FTLD‐TDP n = 3 and Pick's disease n = 1). All but one had Pittsburgh Compound‐B (PiB) PET. Braak staging, Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts and semi‐quantitative tau lesion scores were performed. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a temporal meta‐region‐of‐interest (ROI), entorhinal cortex and cortical/subcortical regions selected to match the tau lesion analysis. Global PiB SUVR was calculated. Autoradiography was performed in one PSP patient, with digital pathology used to quantify tau burden.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine cases (37.5%) had Aβ plaques. Global PiB SUVR correlated with Aβ plaque count, with 100% specificity 50% sensitivity for diffuse plaques. Twenty‐one (87.5%) had Braak I‐IV. Flortaucipir correlated with neurofibrillary tangle counts in entorhinal cortex, but entorhinal and meta‐ROI SUVR were not elevated in Braak IV or primary age‐related tauopathy. Flortaucipir uptake patterns differed across FTLD pathologies and could separate PSP and CBD. Flortaucipir correlated with tau lesion score in red nucleus and midbrain tegmentum across patients, but not in cortical or basal ganglia regions. Autoradiography demonstrated minimal uptake of flortaucipir, although flortaucipir correlated with quantitative tau burden across regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular PET shows expected correlations with Alzheimer‐related pathology but lacks sensitivity to detect mild pathology in FTLD. Regional flortaucipir uptake was able to separate CBD and PSP.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Functional Connectivity Decreases with Metabolic Stress in Sickle Cell Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with sickle cell disease experience cognitive deficits even when unaffected by stroke. Using functional connectivity MRI as a potential biomarker of cognitive function, we tested our hypothesis that children with sickle cell disease would have decreased functional connectivity, and that children experiencing the greatest metabolic stress, indicated by elevated oxygen extraction fraction, would have the lowest connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively obtained brain MRIs and cognitive testing in healthy controls and children with sickle cell disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed data from 60 participants (20 controls, 40 sickle cell disease). There was no difference in global cognition or cognitive subdomains between cohorts. However, we found decreased functional connectivity within the sensory‐motor, lateral sensory‐motor, auditory, salience and subcortical networks in participants with sickle cell disease compared to controls. Further, as white matter oxygen extraction fraction increased, connectivity within the visual (p = 0.008, parameter estimate [95% CI] = ‐0.760 [‐1.297, ‐0.224]), default mode (p = 0.012, parameter estimate [95% CI] = ‐0.417 [‐0.731, ‐0.104]), and cingulo‐opercular (p = 0.009, parameter estimate [95% CI] = ‐0.883 [‐1.517, ‐0.250]) networks decreased.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that there is diminished functional connectivity within these anatomically‐contiguous networks in children with sickle cell disease compared to controls, even when differences are not seen with cognitive testing. Increased white matter oxygen extraction fraction was associated with decreased connectivity in select networks. These data suggest that elevated oxygen extraction fraction and disrupted functional connectivity are potentially pre‐symptomatic neuroimaging biomarkers for cognitive decline in sickle cell disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The SNARE regulator Complexin3 is a target of the cone circadian clock</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25004?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25004?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The SNARE regulator Complexin3 is a target of the cone circadian clock&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d665f76e-4b1c-4cb1-b9db-ba03dd20bf59/cne25004-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complexin3 (CPLX3) is a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses. Here, we show that the expression of CPLX3 is rhythmic at the synaptic terminal of cone photoreceptors with high values during the day and lower values at night. Silencing the circadian clock specifically in cones eliminates rhythmic expression of the protein in cone pedicles. Rhythmic expression of CPLX3 may modulate the synaptic transmission of cone signals to downstream retinal circuits between day and night.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMAL1 is a core component of the mammalian circadian clockwork. Removal of BMAL1 from the retina significantly affects visual information processing in both rod and cone pathways. To identify potential pathways and/or molecules through which BMAL1 alters signal transmission at the cone pedicle, we performed an RNA‐seq differential expression analysis between cone‐specific &lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt; knockout cones (cone‐&lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) and wild‐type (WT) cones. We found 88 genes differentially expressed. Among these, &lt;i&gt;Complexin3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cplx3&lt;/i&gt;), a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses, was downregulated fivefold in the mutant cones. The purpose of this work was to determine whether BMAL1 and/or the cone clock controls CPLX3 protein expression at cone pedicles. We found that CPLX3 expression level was decreased twofold in cone‐&lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; cones. Furthermore, CPLX3 expression was downregulated at night compared to the day in WT cones but remained constitutively low in mutant cones both day and night. The transcript and protein expression levels of &lt;i&gt;Cplx4—&lt;/i&gt;the other complexin expressed in cones—were similar in WT and mutant cones; in WT cones, CPLX4 protein level did not change with the time of day. In silico analysis revealed four potential BMAL1:CLOCK binding sites upstream from exon one of &lt;i&gt;Cplx3&lt;/i&gt; and none upstream of exon one of &lt;i&gt;Cplx4&lt;/i&gt;. Our results suggest that CPLX3 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the cone clock. The modulation of CPLX3 may be a mechanism by which the clock controls the cone synaptic transfer function to second‐order cells and thereby impacts retinal signal processing during the day/night cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Immunohistological and Ultrastructural Study of the Inflammatory Response to Perforated Polyimide Cortical Implants: Mechanisms Underlying Deterioration of Electrophysiological Recording Quality</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00926</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The deterioration of field potential (FP) recording quality and yield by in vivo multielectrode arrays (MEA) within days to weeks of implantation severely limits progress in basic and applied brain research. The prevailing hypothesis is that implantation of MEA platforms initiate and perpetuate inflammatory processes which culminate in the formation of scar tissue (the foreign body response, FBR) around the implant. The FBR leads to progressive degradation of the recording qualities by displacing neurons away from the electrode surfaces, increasing the resistance between neurons (current source) and the sensing pads and by reducing the neurons’ excitable membrane properties and functional synaptic connectivity through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Meticulous attempts to causally relate the cellular composition, cell density, and electrical properties of the FBR have failed to unequivocally correlate the deterioration of recording quality with the histological severity of the FBR. Based on confocal and electron microscope analysis of thin sections of polyimide based MEA implants along with the surrounding brain tissue at different points in time after implantation, we propose that abrupt FP amplitude attenuation occurs at the implant/brain-parenchyma junction as a result of high seal resistance insulation formed by adhering microglia to the implant surfaces. In contrast to the prevailing hypothesis, that FP decrease occurs across the encapsulating scar of the implanted MEA, this mechanism potentially explains why no correlations have been found between the dimensions and density of the FBR and the recording quality. Recognizing that the seal resistance formed by adhering-microglia to the implant constitutes a downstream element undermining extracellular FP recordings, suggests that approaches to mitigate the formation of the insulating glial could lead to improved recording quality and yield.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: IL-33 Alleviated Brain Damage via Anti-apoptosis, Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress, and Inflammation After Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00898</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interleukin (IL)-33 belongs to a novel chromatin-associated cytokine newly recognized by the IL-1 family, and its specific receptor is the orphan IL-1 receptor (ST2). Cumulative evidence suggests that IL-33 plays a crucial effect on the pathological changes and pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS) diseases and injuries, such as recurrent neonatal seizures (RNS). However, the specific roles of IL-33 and its related molecular mechanisms in RNS remain confused. In the present study, we investigated the protein expression changes and co-localized cell types of IL-33 or ST2, as well as the effect of IL-33 on RNS-induced neurobehavioral defects, weight loss, and apoptosis. Moreover, an inhibitor of IL-33, anti-IL-33 was performed to further exploited underlying mechanisms. We found that administration of IL-33 up-regulated the expression levels of IL-33 and ST2, and increased the number of its co-localization with Olig-2-positive oligodendrocytes and NeuN-positive neurons at 72 h post-RNS. Noteworthily, RNS-induced neurobehavioral deficits, bodyweight loss, and spatial learning and memory impairment, as well as cell apoptosis, were reversed by IL-33 pretreatment. Additionally, the increase in IL-1β and TNF-α levels, up-regulation of ER stress, as well as a decrease in anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and an increase in pro-apoptotic protein CC-3 induced by RNS are prevented by administration of IL-33. Moreover, IL-33 in combination with Anti-IL-33 significantly inverted the effects of IL-33 or Anti-IL-33 alone on apoptosis, ER stress, and inflammation. Collectively, these data suggest that IL-33 attenuates RNS-induced neurobehavioral disorders, bodyweight loss, and spatial learning and memory deficits, at least in part through mechanisms involved in inhibition of apoptosis, ER stress, and neuro-inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Dystrophin Is Required for the Proper Timing in Retinal Histogenesis: A Thorough Investigation on the mdx Mouse Model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00760</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00760</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal X-linked muscular disease caused by defective expression of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin (Dp427). Selected autonomic and central neurons, including retinal neurons, express Dp427 and/or dystrophin shorter isoforms. Because of this, DMD patients may also experience different forms of cognitive impairment, neurological and autonomic disorders, and specific visual defects. DMD-related damages to the nervous system are established during development, suggesting a role for all dystrophin isoforms in neural circuit development and differentiation; however, to date, their function in retinogenesis has never been investigated. In this large-scale study, we analyzed whether the lack of Dp427 affects late retinogenesis in the mdx mouse, the most well studied animal model of DMD. Retinal gene expression and layer maturation, as well as neural cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, were evaluated in E18 and/or P0, P5, P10, and adult mice. In mdx mice, expression of Capn3, Id3 (E18-P5), and Dtnb (P5) genes, encoding proteins involved in different aspects of retina development and synaptogenesis (e.g., Calpain 3, DNA-binding protein inhibitor-3, and β-dystrobrevin, respectively), was transiently reduced compared to age-matched wild type mice. Concomitantly, a difference in the time required for the retinal ganglion cell layer to reach appropriate thickness was observed (P0–P5). Immunolabeling for specific cell markers also evidenced a significant dysregulation in the number of GABAergic amacrine cells (P5–P10), a transient decrease in the area immunopositive for the Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 1 (VGluT1) during ribbon synapse maturation (P10) and a reduction in the number of calretinin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (adults). Finally, the number of proliferating retinal progenitor cells (P5–P10) and apoptotic cells (P10) was reduced. These results support the hypothesis of a role for Dp427 during late retinogenesis different from those proposed in consolidated neural circuits. In particular, Dp427 may be involved in shaping specific steps of retina differentiation. Notably, although most of the above described quantitative alterations recover over time, the number of calretinin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; RGCs is reduced only in the mature retina. This suggests that alterations subtler than the timing of retinal maturation may occur, a hypothesis that demands further in-depth functional studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The understanding of human and non-human microstructural brain alterations in the course of neurodegenerative diseases has substantially improved by the non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Animal models (including disease or knockout models) allow for a variety of experimental manipulations, which are not applicable to humans. Thus, the DTI approach provides a promising tool for cross-species cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations of the neurobiological targets and mechanisms of neurodegeneration. This overview with a systematic review focuses on the principles of DTI analysis as used in studies at the group level in living preclinical models of neurodegeneration. The translational aspect from in-vivo animal models toward (clinical) applications in humans is covered as well as the DTI-based research of the non-human brains' microstructure, the methodological aspects in data processing and analysis, and data interpretation at different abstraction levels. The aim of integrating DTI in multiparametric or multimodal imaging protocols will allow the interrogation of DTI data in terms of directional flow of information and may identify the microstructural underpinnings of neurodegeneration-related patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Perspective: Evolution of Control Variables and Policies for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson’s Disease Using Bidirectional Deep-Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A deep brain stimulation system capable of closed-loop neuromodulation is a type of bidirectional deep brain-computer interface (dBCI), in which neural signals are recorded, decoded, and then used as the input commands for neuromodulation at the same site in the brain. The challenge in assuring successful implementation of bidirectional dBCIs in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is to discover and decode stable, robust and reliable neural inputs that can be tracked during stimulation, and to optimize neurostimulation patterns and parameters (control policies) for motor behaviors at the brain interface, which are customized to the individual. In this perspective, we will outline the work done in our lab regarding the evolution of the discovery of neural and behavioral control variables relevant to PD, the development of a novel personalized dual-threshold control policy relevant to the individual’s therapeutic window and the application of these to investigations of closed-loop STN DBS driven by neural or kinematic inputs, using the first generation of bidirectional dBCIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Action real-time strategy gaming (ARSG)—a major genre of action video gaming (AVG)—has both action and strategy elements. ARSG requires attention, visual working memory (VWM), sensorimotor skills, team cooperation, and strategy-making abilities, thus offering promising insights into the learning-induced plasticity. However, it is yet unknown whether the ARSG experience is related to the development of VWM capacity. Using both behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measurements, this study tested whether ARSG experts had larger VWM capacity than non-experts in a change detection task. The behavioral results showed that ARSG experts had higher accuracy and larger VWM capacity than non-experts. In addition, the ERP results revealed that the difference wave of the contralateral delay activity (CDA) component (size 4–size 2) elicited by experts was significantly larger than that of non-experts, suggesting that the VWM capacity was higher in experts than in non-experts. Thus, the findings suggested that prolonged ARSG experience is correlative with the enhancement of VWM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Human Brain Dynamics Reflect the Correctness and Presentation Modality of Physics Concept Memory Retrieval</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human memory retrieval is the core cognitive process of the human brain whenever it is processing the information. Less study has focused on exploring the neural correlates of the memory retrieval of scientific concepts when presented in word and picture modalities. Fewer studies have investigated the differences in the involved brain regions and how the brain dynamics in these regions would associate with the accuracy of the memory retrieval process. Therefore, this study specifically focused on investigating the human brain dynamics of participants when they retrieve physics concepts in word vs. pictorial modalities, and whether electroencephalogram (EEG) activities can predict the correctness of the retrieval of physics concepts. The results indicated that word modality induced a significant stronger right frontal theta augmentation than pictorial modality during the physics concepts retrieval process, whereas the picture modality induced a significantly greater right parietal alpha suppression than the word modality throughout the retrieval process spurred by the physics concept presentations. In addition, greater frontal midline theta augmentation was observed for incorrect responses than the correct responses during retrieve physics concepts. Moreover, the frontal midline theta power has greater negative predictive power for predicting the accuracy of physics concepts retrieval. In summary, the participants were more likely to retrieve physics concepts correctly if a lower amount of theta were allocated during the maintaining period from 2,000 ms through 3,500 ms before making responses. It provides insight for our future application of brain computer interface (BCI) in real-time science learning. This study implies that the lower frontal midline theta power is associated with a lower degree of cognitive control and active maintenance of representations as participants approach a correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effects of Physical Exercise on Cognition: How Heart Rate Variability Can Predict Cognitive Performances</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00312</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00312</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Investigate and identify the relationship between physical exercise and cognitive performance measured by using different cognitive tests taken from Cambridge Brain Science (CBS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty subjects, divided into two groups (aerobic and effort), undergo twelve cognitive tests from CBS. A comparison between the pre- and post-exercise results in terms of cognitive performance differences is carried out. Regression analysis between Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features and CBS tests results is performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In most CBS tests, there is an improvement, or at least a confirmation, of the subject's cognitive ability, for both groups. Reasoning (80–100%), concentration (80–87%), and planning tests (93–100%) seem to undergo critical positive changes. The regression analysis, performed by using a set of different algorithms, has demonstrated that it is possible, by monitoring the HRV during the exercise, to predict to some extent the cognitive performance, i.e., the CBS tests results. The best performing regression algorithms are Simple Linear (Quade Test—aerobic group: 2.098, effort group: 3.350, both groups: 2.747) and REPTree (Quade Test—aerobic group: 2.955, effort group: 3.315, both groups: 3.121). The statistical analysis has proved that physical activity is statistically useful for the subjects in improving their cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This study has numerically appraised the improvement, the conservation, or the worsening on different aspects of cognition. The found mathematical relationship between physical exercise and cognitive performance suggests that it is possible to predict the beneficial effect of various exercises on executive and attentive control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Impact of Physical Obstacles on the Structural and Effective Connectivity of in silico Neuronal Circuits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Scaffolds and patterned substrates are among the most successful strategies to dictate the connectivity between neurons in culture. Here, we used numerical simulations to investigate the capacity of physical obstacles placed on a flat substrate to shape structural connectivity, and in turn collective dynamics and effective connectivity, in biologically-realistic neuronal networks. We considered μ-sized obstacles placed in mm-sized networks. Three main obstacle shapes were explored, namely crosses, circles and triangles of isosceles profile. They occupied either a small area fraction of the substrate or populated it entirely in a periodic manner. From the point of view of structure, all obstacles promoted short length-scale connections, shifted the in- and out-degree distributions toward lower values, and increased the modularity of the networks. The capacity of obstacles to shape distinct structural traits depended on their density and the ratio between axonal length and substrate diameter. For high densities, different features were triggered depending on obstacle shape, with crosses trapping axons in their vicinity and triangles funneling axons along the reverse direction of their tip. From the point of view of dynamics, obstacles reduced the capacity of networks to spontaneously activate, with triangles in turn strongly dictating the direction of activity propagation. Effective connectivity networks, inferred using transfer entropy, exhibited distinct modular traits, indicating that the presence of obstacles facilitated the formation of local effective microcircuits. Our study illustrates the potential of physical constraints to shape structural blueprints and remodel collective activity, and may guide investigations aimed at mimicking organizational traits of biological neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Alcohol Use Disorder, Neurodegeneration, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease: Interplay Between Oxidative Stress, Neuroimmune Response and Excitotoxicity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Prolonged excessive alcohol intake contributes to increased production of reactive oxygen species that triggers neuroimmune response and cellular apoptosis and necrosis via lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial, protein or DNA damage. Long term binge alcohol consumption also upregulates glutamate receptors, glucocorticoids and reduces reuptake of glutamate in the central nervous system, resulting in glutamate excitotoxicity, and eventually mitochondrial injury and cell death. In this review, we delineate the following principles in alcohol-induced neurodegeneration: (1) alcohol-induced oxidative stress, (2) neuroimmune response toward increased oxidants and lipopolysaccharide, (3) glutamate excitotoxicity and cell injury, and (4) interplay between oxidative stress, neuroimmune response and excitotoxicity leading to neurodegeneration and (5) potential chronic alcohol intake-induced development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Illuminating and Sniffing Out the Neuromodulatory Roles of Dopamine in the Retina and Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00275</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous system, dopamine is well-known as the neuromodulator that is involved with regulating reward, addiction, motivation, and fine motor control. Yet, decades of findings are revealing another crucial function of dopamine: modulating sensory systems. Dopamine is endogenous to subsets of neurons in the retina and olfactory bulb (OB), where it sharpens sensory processing of visual and olfactory information. For example, dopamine modulation allows the neural circuity in the retina to transition from processing dim light to daylight and the neural circuity in the OB to regulate odor discrimination and detection. Dopamine accomplishes these tasks through numerous, complex mechanisms in both neural structures. In this review, we provide an overview of the established and emerging research on these mechanisms and describe similarities and differences in dopamine expression and modulation of synaptic transmission in the retinas and OBs of various vertebrate organisms. This includes discussion of dopamine neurons’ morphologies, potential identities, and biophysical properties along with their contributions to circadian rhythms and stimulus-driven synthesis, activation, and release of dopamine. As dysregulation of some of these mechanisms may occur in patients with Parkinson’s disease, these symptoms are also discussed. The exploration and comparison of these two separate dopamine populations shows just how remarkably similar the retina and OB are, even though they are functionally distinct. It also shows that the modulatory properties of dopamine neurons are just as important to vision and olfaction as they are to motor coordination and neuropsychiatric/neurodegenerative conditions, thus, we hope this review encourages further research to elucidate these mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Blood Pressure in Different Dementia Disorders, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Subjective Cognitive Decline</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00257</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00257</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was to investigate whether blood pressure (BP) differed among people with different dementia diagnoses, mild cognitive impairment, and subjective cognitive decline and whether BP differences were observed across age and sex. Our study population comprised clinical data from 6,236 patients (53.5% women) aged 45–97 years (Mean = 73.9, SD = 9.6) referred to dementia assessment in 42 outpatient clinics across Norway during 2009–2019. Patients with the following diagnoses were included: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Vascular dementia (VaD), mixed AD and VaD, and dementia in Parkinson’s disease/Lewy body disease (PDD/LBD). For all diagnostic groups, SBP increased with age until about 80 years, after which it trended downward, whereas DBP declined after 60 years of age for all diagnostic groups. Patients aged 65 years and younger with SCD had lower SBP compared to AD patients at the same age, but SBP increased rapidly with increasing age, resulting in a substantially higher SBP at 80 + years compared with all other diagnostic groups. No other differences in SBP or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were found among patients with the different dementia diagnosis. Neither SBP nor DBP differed between MCI and AD groups. An interaction between age and gender was found for SBP at younger ages, as women started out with a lower pressure than men did but ended up with higher SBP.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Among 80+ patients, blood pressure did not differ as a function of the various dementia disorders. The SBP for the SCD patients of various age groups differed from all other diagnostic groups, indicating either that internal regulation of BP in older people is a risk factor for dementia or that brain damage causing dementia or MCI may led to changes in blood pressure. Brain aging seems to influence SBP differently in men and women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Altered Brain Function in Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Patients With Gait Disorders: A Resting-State Functional MRI Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00234</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gait disturbances are important clinical features of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) that increase the risk of falls and disability. Brain structural alterations and gait disturbances in CSVD patients have been well demonstrated. However, intrinsic resting cerebral function patterns in CSVD patients with gait disorders remain largely unknown. Fifty-eight CSVD patients were enrolled in our studies and categorized into the gait disorder group (CSVD-GD, n = 29) and no-gait disorder group (CSVD-NGD, n = 29) based on a gait examination. Gait was quantitatively assessed with the Timed Up and Go test and the intelligent device for energy expenditure and activity (IDEEA). Functional MRI and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) analyses were employed to explore local intrinsic neural oscillation alterations. Functional connectivity based on fALFF results was calculated to detect the potential changes in remote connectivity. Compared with the CSVD-NGD group, the CSVD-GD group showed decreased fALFF in regions mainly located in the sensorimotor network and frontoparietal network, such as the left supplementary motor area (SMA.L) and the left superior parietal gyrus, and increased fALFF in the right inferior frontal gyrus (orbital part), the left caudate, and the left precuneus. Moreover, the CSVD-GD patients exhibited lower connectivity between the SMA.L and temporal lobe, which was related to gait speed. The fALFF value of the SMA.L was associated with cadence. This study highlights the regional and network interaction abnormalities of the SMA in CSVD patients with gait disturbances. These findings could provide further insight into the neural mechanisms of gait disturbances in CSVD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Mitochondrial tRNA Mutation Causes Axonal CMT in a Large Venezuelan Family</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25854?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25854?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to identify the genetic cause for progressive peripheral nerve disease in a Venezuelan family. Despite the growing list of genes associated with Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease, many patients with axonal forms lack a genetic diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pedigree was constructed, based on family clinical data. Next‐generation sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was performed for 6 affected family members. Muscle biopsies from 4 family members were used for analysis of muscle histology and ultrastructure, mtDNA sequencing, and RNA quantification. Ultrastructural studies were performed on sensory nerve biopsies from 2 affected family members.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrodiagnostic testing showed a motor and sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Pedigree analysis revealed inheritance only through the maternal line, consistent with mitochondrial transmission. Sequencing of mtDNA identified a mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Val&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;mt‐tRNA&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Val&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;) gene, m.1661A&amp;gt;G, present at nearly 100% heteroplasmy, which disrupts a Watson–Crick base pair in the T‐stem‐loop. Muscle biopsies showed chronic denervation/reinnervation changes, whereas biochemical analysis of electron transport chain (ETC) enzyme activities showed reduction in multiple ETC complexes. Northern blots from skeletal muscle total RNA showed severe reduction in abundance of &lt;i&gt;mt‐tRNA&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Val&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;, and mildly increased &lt;i&gt;mt‐tRNA&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Phe&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;, in subjects compared with unrelated age‐ and sex‐matched controls. Nerve biopsies from 2 affected family members demonstrated ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities (hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and crystalline arrays) consistent with a mitochondrial neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identify a previously unreported cause of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease, a mutation in the &lt;i&gt;mt‐tRNA&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Val&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;, in a Venezuelan family. This work expands the list of CMT‐associated genes from protein‐coding genes to a mitochondrial &lt;i&gt;tRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Bornavirus Encephalitis Shows a Characteristic Magnetic Resonance Phenotype in Humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25873?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25873?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of diagnosed fatal encephalitis cases in humans caused by the classical Borna disease virus (BoDV‐1) has been increasing, ever since it was proved that BoDV‐1 can cause human infections. However, awareness of this entity is low, and a specific imaging pattern has not yet been identified. We therefore provide the first comprehensive description of the morphology of human BoDV‐1 encephalitis, with histopathological verification of imaging abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an institutional review board‐approved multicenter study, we carried out a retrospective analysis of 55 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of 19 patients with confirmed BoDV‐1 encephalitis. Fifty brain regions were analyzed systematically (T1w, T2w, T2*w, T1w + Gd, and DWI), in order to discern a specific pattern of inflammation. Histopathological analysis of 25 locations in one patient served as correlation for MRI abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline imaging, acquired at a mean of 11 ± 10 days after symptom onset, in addition to follow‐up scans of 16 patients, revealed characteristic T2 hyperintensities with a predilection for the head of the caudate nucleus, insula, and cortical spread to the limbic system, whereas the occipital lobes and cerebellar hemispheres were unaffected. This gradient was confirmed by histology. Nine patients (47.4%) developed T1 hyperintensities of the basal ganglia, corresponding to accumulated lipid phagocytes on histology and typical for late‐stage necrosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BoDV‐1 encephalitis shows a distinct pattern of inflammation in both the early and late stages of the disease. Its appearance can mimic sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease on MRI and should be considered a differential diagnosis in the case of atypical clinical presentation.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Circulating Metabolites Differentiate Acute Ischemic Stroke from Stroke Mimics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25859?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25859?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early discrimination of patients with ischemic stroke (IS) from stroke mimics (SMs) poses a diagnostic challenge. The circulating metabolome might reflect pathophysiological events related to acute IS. Here, we investigated the utility of early metabolic changes for differentiating IS from SM.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed untargeted metabolomics on serum samples obtained from patients with IS (N = 508) and SM (N = 349; defined by absence of a diffusion weighted imaging [DWI] positive lesion on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) who presented to the hospital within 24 hours after symptom onset (median time from symptom onset to blood sampling = 3.3 hours; interquartile range [IQR] = 1.6–6.7 hours) and from neurologically normal controls (NCs; N = 112). We compared diagnostic groups in a discovery‐validation approach by applying multivariable linear regression models, machine learning techniques, and propensity score matching. We further performed a targeted look‐up of published metabolite sets.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of 41 metabolites were significantly associated with IS compared to NCs. The top metabolites showing the highest value in separating IS from SMs were asymmetrical and symmetrical dimethylarginine, pregnenolone sulfate, and adenosine. Together, these 4 metabolites differentiated patients with IS from SMs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 in the replication sample, which was superior to multimodal cranial computed tomography (CT; AUC = 0.80) obtained for routine diagnostics. They were further superior to previously published metabolite sets detected in our samples. All 4 metabolites returned to control levels by day 90.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of 4 metabolites with known biological effects relevant to stroke pathophysiology shows unprecedented utility to identify patients with IS upon hospital arrival, thus encouraging further investigation, including multicenter studies. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Modeling microbial metabolic trade-offs in a chemostat</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhiyuan Li, Bo Liu, Sophia Hsin-Jung Li, Christopher G. King, Zemer Gitai, Ned S. Wingreen&lt;/p&gt;

Microbes face intense competition in the natural world, and so need to wisely allocate their resources to multiple functions, in particular to metabolism. Understanding competition among metabolic strategies that are subject to trade-offs is therefore crucial for deeper insight into the competition, cooperation, and community assembly of microorganisms. In this work, we evaluate competing metabolic strategies within an ecological context by considering not only how the environment influences cell growth, but also how microbes shape their chemical environment. Utilizing chemostat-based resource-competition models, we exhibit a set of intuitive and general procedures for assessing metabolic strategies. Using this framework, we are able to relate and unify multiple metabolic models, and to demonstrate how the fitness landscape of strategies becomes intrinsically dynamic due to species-environment feedback. Such dynamic fitness landscapes produce rich behaviors, and prove to be crucial for ecological and evolutionarily stable coexistence in all the models we examined.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/swn6bAByPBQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Age‐related hearing loss: Why we need to think about sex as a biological variable</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has long been known that age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) is more common, more severe, and with an earlier onset in men compared to women. Even in the absence of confounding factors such as noise exposure, these sexdifferences in susceptibility to ARHL remain. In the last decade, insight into the pleiotrophic nature by which estrogen signaling can impact multiple signaling mechanisms to mediate downstream changes in gene expression and/or elicit rapid changes in cellular function has rapidly gathered pace, and a role for estrogen signaling in the biological pathways that confer neuroprotection is becoming undeniable. Here I review the evidence why we need to consider sex as a biological variable (SABV) when investigating the etiology of ARHL. Loss of auditory function with aging is frequency‐specific and modulated by SABV. Evidence also suggests that differences in cochlear physiology between women and men are already present from birth. Understanding the molecular basis of these sex differences in ARHL will accelerate the development of precision medicine therapies for ARHL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Certain aspects of central presbycusis such as temporal processing can largely exist independent of peripheral presbycusis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deleterious age‐related changes in the central auditory nervous system have been referred to as central age‐related hearing impairment (ARHI) or central presbycusis. Central ARHI is often assumed to be the consequence of peripheral ARHI. However, it is possible that certain aspects of central ARHI are independent from peripheral ARHI. A confirmation of this possibility could lead to significant improvements in current rehabilitation practices. The major difficulty in addressing this issue arises from confounding factors, such as other age‐related changes in both the cochlea and central non‐auditory brain structures. Because gap detection is a common measure of central auditory temporal processing, and gap detection thresholds are less influenced by changes in other brain functions such as learning and memory, we investigated the potential relationship between age‐related peripheral hearing loss (i.e., audiograms) and age‐related changes in gap detection. Consistent with previous studies, a significant difference was found for gap detection thresholds between young and older adults. However, among older adults, no significant associations were observed between gap detection ability and several other independent variables including the pure tone audiogram average, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐Vocabulary score, gender, and age. Statistical analyses showed little or no contributions from these independent variables to gap detection thresholds. Thus, our data indicate that age‐related decline in central temporal processing is largely independent of peripheral ARHI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and aldosterone all demonstrate vital roles in sustaining auditory function through either the maintenance of cochlear neurons, up/down regulation of critical molecules (i.e., IGF‐1, BDNF, etc.), or generation of the endocochlear potential. With disease and/or age, hormone expression begins to decline drastically, which ultimately affects cochlear structures and the integrity of cochlear cells. The following review explores the latest findings as well as realistic outcomes for hormone therapy treatment in the auditory system. This information could serve as a potential guide for patients considering hormone therapy as a medicinal choice to alleviate the signs of onset of presbycusis—age‐related hearing loss. Additional scientific investigations could also be carried out to further enhance recent findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Ultrastructural defects in stereocilia and tectorial membrane in aging mouse and human cochleae&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a84d52e8-9bc3-4dc0-aa38-b4d75f4a3d2f/jnr24556-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have described and investigated the pathologies of aging cochlea in both mice and humans to identify where aging pathologies are similar and different between the two. We have identified common pathological changes that are likely to have significant effects on hearing, improving the understanding of age‐related hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aging cochlea is subjected to a number of pathological changes to play a role in the onset of age‐related hearing loss (ARHL). Although ARHL has often been thought of as the result of the loss of hair cells, it is in fact a disorder with a complex etiology, arising from the changes to both the organ of Corti and its supporting structures. In this study, we examine two aging pathologies that have not been studied in detail despite their apparent prevalence; the fusion, elongation, and engulfment of cochlear inner hair cell stereocilia, and the changes that occur to the tectorial membrane (TM), a structure overlying the organ of Corti that modulates its physical properties in response to sound. Our work demonstrates that similar pathological changes occur in these two structures in the aging cochleae of both mice and humans, examines the ultrastructural changes that underlie stereocilial fusion, and identifies the lost TM components that lead to changes in membrane structure. We place these changes into the context of the wider pathology of the aging cochlea, and identify how they may be important in particular for understanding the more subtle hearing pathologies that precede auditory threshold loss in ARHL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) has recently been confirmed as a common complex trait, that is, it is heritable with many genetic variants each contributing a small amount of risk, as well as environmental determinants. Historically, attempts to identify the genetic variants underlying the ARHL have been of limited success, relying on the selection of candidate genes based on the limited knowledge of the pathophysiology of the condition, and linkage studies in samples comprising related individuals. More recently genome‐wide association studies have been performed, but these require very large samples having consistent and reliable phenotyping for hearing loss (HL), and early attempts suffered from lack of reliable replication of their findings. Replicated variants shown associated with ARHL include those lying in genes &lt;i&gt;GRM7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ISG20&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TRIOBP&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; ILDR1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;EYA4.&lt;/i&gt; The availability of large biobanks and the development of collaborative consortia have led to a breakthrough over the last couple of years, and many new genetic variants associated with ARHL are becoming available, through the analysis publicly available bioresources and electronic health records. These findings along with immunohistochemistry and mouse models of HL look set to help disentangle the genetic architecture of ARHL, and highlight the need for standardization of phenotyping methods to facilitate data sharing and collaboration across research networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Differential deletion of GDNF in the auditory system leads to altered sound responsiveness</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Differential deletion of GDNF in the auditory system leads to altered sound responsiveness&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8d1a1536-02d5-4d52-b2d2-15e2fa1a663e/jnr24544-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deficiency of GDNF in cochlear hair cells (Atoh1‐Cre) reduces inner hair cell (IHC)/cochlear output, although outer hair cell (OHC) function is normal. Deficiency of GDNF in cochlear neurons (TrkC‐Cre) leads to increased OHC and IHC/auditory nerve responses. Tissue‐specific GDNF expression during development is thus required to maintain normal hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glial‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been proposed as a potent neurotrophic factor with the potential to cure neurodegenerative diseases. In the cochlea, GDNF has been detected in auditory neurons and sensory receptor cells and its expression is upregulated upon trauma. Moreover, the application of GDNF in different animal models of deafness has shown its capacity to prevent hearing loss and promoted its future use in therapeutic trials in humans. In the present study we have examined the endogenous requirement of GDNF during auditory development in mice. Using a &lt;i&gt;lacZ&lt;/i&gt; knockin allele we have confirmed the expression of GDNF in the cochlea including its sensory regions during development. Global inactivation of GDNF throughout the hearing system using a &lt;i&gt;Foxg1‐&lt;/i&gt;Cre line causes perinatal lethality but reveals no apparent defects during formation of the cochlea. Using &lt;i&gt;TrkC‐&lt;/i&gt;Cre and &lt;i&gt;Atoh1‐&lt;/i&gt;Cre lines, we were able to generate viable mutants lacking GDNF in auditory neurons or both auditory neurons and sensory hair cells. These mutants show normal frequency‐dependent auditory thresholds. However, mechanoelectrical response properties of outer hair cells (OHCs) in &lt;i&gt;TrkC‐&lt;/i&gt;Cre &lt;i&gt;GDNF&lt;/i&gt; mutants are altered at low thresholds. Furthermore, auditory brainstem wave analysis shows an abnormal increase of wave I. On the other hand, &lt;i&gt;Atoh1‐&lt;/i&gt;Cre &lt;i&gt;GDNF&lt;/i&gt; mutants show normal OHC function but their auditory brainstem wave pattern is reduced at the levels of wave I, III and IV. These results show that GDNF expression during the development is required to maintain functional hearing at different levels of the auditory system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Auditory temporal acuity improves with age in the male mouse auditory thalamus: A role for perineuronal nets?&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0899a52f-7138-4208-a12e-2ceb61da686d/jnr24537-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recordings made from ventral (v) and medial (m) MGB of middle‐aged, normally hearing, CBA/Ca male mice showed improved synchronization to rapidly varying stimuli. Increased precision was associated with localized expression of perineuronal net and axonal coats. This suggests the MGB retains significant capacity for anatomical and electrophysiological plasticity, maximizing efficiency into older age. Created in part with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.BioRender.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;BioRender.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to perceive and interpret environmental sound accurately is conserved across many species and is fundamental for understanding communication via vocalizations. Auditory acuity and temporally controlled neuronal firing underpin this ability. Deterioration in neuronal firing precision likely contributes to poorer hearing performance, yet the role of neural processing by key nuclei in the central auditory pathways is not fully understood. Here, we record from the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body [MGB]) of young and middle‐aged, normally hearing male CBA/Ca mice. We report changes in temporal processing of auditory stimuli, with neurons recorded from ventral and medial MGB subdivisions of older animals more likely to synchronize to rapid temporally varying stimuli. MGB subdivisions also showed increased probability of neuronal firing and shorter response latencies to clicks in older animals. Histological investigation of neuronal extracellular specializations, perineuronal nets (PNNs) and axonal coats, in the MGB identified greater organization of PNNs around MGB neurons and the presence of axonal coats within older animals. This supports the observation that neural responses recorded from ventral and medial MGB of older mice were more likely to synchronize to temporally varying stimuli presented at faster repetition rates than those recorded from young adult animals. These changes are observed in animals with normal hearing thresholds, confirming that neural processing differs between the MGB subdivisions and such processing is associated with age‐related changes to PNNs. Understanding these age‐related changes and how they occur have important implications for the design of effective therapeutic interventions to improve speech intelligibility into later life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: The effects of age and sex on the detection of pure tones by adult CBA/CaJ mice (Mus musculus)</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The effects of age and sex on the detection of pure tones by adult CBA/CaJ mice (Mus musculus)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/619505b4-dc08-4f4d-a868-fb3e4813ec71/jnr24496-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operant conditioning and a longitudinal design can be used to trace hearing loss for pure tones in CBA/CaJ mice. Male and female mice exhibit similar hearing sensitivity up to 645 days of age. Later in life, male mice lose hearing at a faster rate than females, paralleling hearing loss in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a gradual decrease in hearing sensitivity. Previous electrophysiological and behavioral studies have demonstrated that the CBA/CaJ mouse strain is an appropriate model for the late‐onset hearing loss found in humans. However, few studies have characterized hearing in these mice behaviorally using longitudinal methodologies. The goal of this research was to utilize a longitudinal design and operant conditioning procedures with positive reinforcement to construct audiograms and temporal integration functions in aging CBA/CaJ mice. In the first experiment, thresholds were collected for 8, 16, 24, 42, and 64 kHz pure tones in 30 male and 35 female CBA/CaJ mice. Similar to humans, mice had higher thresholds for high frequency tones than for low frequency pure tones across the lifespan. Female mice had better hearing acuity than males after 645 days of age. In the second experiment, temporal integration functions were constructed for 18 male and 18 female mice for 16 and 64 kHz tones varying in duration. Mice showed an increase in thresholds for tones shorter than 200 ms, reaching peak performance at shorter durations than other rodent species. Overall, CBA/CaJ mice experience ARHL for pure tones of different frequencies and durations, making them a good model for studies on hearing loss. These findings highlight the importance of using a wide range of stimuli and a longitudinal design when comparing presbycusis across different species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presbycusis, or age‐related hearing loss (ARHL), occurs in most mammals with variations in the age of onset, rate of decline, and magnitude of degeneration in the central nervous system and inner ear. The affected cochlear structures include the stria vascularis and its vasculature, spiral ligament, sensory hair cells and auditory neurons. Dysfunction of the stria vascularis results in a reduced endocochlear potential. Without this potential, the cochlear amplification provided by the electro‐motility of the outer hair cells is insufficient, and a high‐frequency hearing‐loss results. Degeneration of the sensory cells, especially the outer hair cells also leads to hearing loss due to lack of amplification. Neuronal degeneration, another hallmark of ARHL, most likely underlies difficulties with speech discrimination, especially in noisy environments. Noise exposure is a major cause of ARHL. It is well‐known to cause sensory cell degeneration, especially the outer hair cells at the high frequency end of the cochlea. Even loud, but not uncomfortable, sound levels can lead to synaptopathy and ultimately neuronal degeneration. Even in the absence of a noisy environment, aged cells degenerate. This pathology most likely results from damage to mitochondria and contributes to degenerative changes in the stria vascularis, hair cells, and neurons. The genetic underpinnings of ARHL are still unknown and most likely involve various combinations of genes. At present, the only effective strategy for reducing ARHL is prevention of noise exposure. If future strategies can improve mitochondrial activity and reduce oxidative damage in old age, these should also bring relief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathophysiology of age‐related hearing loss (ARHL), or presbycusis, involves a complex interplay between environmental and genetic factors. The fundamental biomolecular mechanisms of ARHL have been well described, including the roles of membrane transport, reactive oxygen species, cochlear synaptopathy, vascular insults, hormones, and microRNA, to name a few. The genetic basis underlying these mechanisms remains under‐investigated and poorly understood. The emergence of genome‐wide association studies has allowed for the identification of specific groups of genes involved in ARHL. This review highlights recent advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of ARHL, the genetic basis underlying these processes and suggests future directions for research and potential therapeutic avenues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Differential Development of Myelin in Zebra Finch Song Nuclei&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0b3585fe-3dac-4913-8201-414dac92d518/cne25019-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forebrain song nuclei in adult songbirds exhibit distinct myelination patterns, yet little is known about myelin development. We demonstrate different developmental rates and final levels of myelination across five major song nuclei. This differential myelin development could contribute to different aspects of song acquisition and production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Songbirds learn vocalizations by hearing and practicing songs. As song develops, the tempo becomes faster and more precise. In the songbird brain, discrete nuclei form interconnected myelinated circuits that control song acquisition and production. The myelin sheath increases the speed of action potential propagation by insulating the axons of neurons and by reducing membrane capacitance. As the brain develops, myelin increases in density, but the time course of myelin development across discrete song nuclei has not been systematically studied in a quantitative fashion. We tested the hypothesis that myelination develops differentially across time and song nuclei. We examined myelin development in the brains of the zebra finch (&lt;i&gt;Taeniopygia guttata&lt;/i&gt;) from chick at posthatch day (d) 8 to adult (up to 147 d) in five major song nuclei: HVC (proper name), robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), Area X, lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN) and medial portion of the dorsolateral thalamic nucleus (DLM). All of these nuclei showed an increase in the density of myelination during development but at different rates and to different final degrees. Exponential curve fits revealed that DLM showed earlier myelination than other nuclei, and HVC showed the slowest myelination of song nuclei. Together, these data show differential maturation of myelination in different portions of the song system. Such differential maturation would be well placed to play a role in regulating the development of learned song.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;A Proteomic View on the Differential Phenotype of Schwann Cells derived from Mouse Sensory and Motor nerves&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f4483233-6164-4a19-8644-d9f99241606b/cne25018-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwann cells were found to have sensory and motor phenotypes and associated with the modality specific promotion of sensory and motor nerve regeneration. To explore the differences between them, we established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. The SNdSCs and MNdSCs were isolated from dorsal and ventral roots by FACS sorting. The proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs was compared by a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling and the mouse Schwann proteome was obtained. Several differentially expressed proteins between SNdSCs and MNdSCs were verified.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwann cells (SCs) are myelin‐forming glial cells of the peripheral nervous system. Recent studies suggested that SCs comprise two phenotypes: sensory SCs and motor SCs, which are associated with the modality‐specific promotion of sensory and motor axon growth during peripheral neuronal regeneration. However, the molecular basis of the two phenotypic SCs is unclear. We established a workflow to obtain highly purified SCs derived from sensory nerve (SNdSCs) and motor nerve (MNdSCs) from B6; D2‐Tg(s100B‐EGFP)1Wjt/J mice. Subsequently, a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ labeling was performed to compare the proteome of SNdSCs and MNdSCs. A total of 6,567 proteins were identified, of which 63 and 11 proteins were overexpressed in SNdSCs and MNdSCs, respectively. Three of the overexpressed proteins were further validated by Western blot and immunocytochemistry: GMFB and CNPase, which were overexpressed in sensory SNdSCs, and histone H4, which was overexpressed in MNdSCs. The expression pattern of the three proteins was also validated in the dorsal roots and ventral roots. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that proteins highly expressed in SNdSCs are mainly involved in RNA processing and protein synthesis, while those overexpressed in MNdSCs are related to cell proliferation. Real‐time cell analysis confirmed that the proliferation activity of MNdSCs is higher than that of SNdSCs. This study is the first to provide a proteomic view of the differential phenotype of mouse SNdSCs and MNdSCs. The data may serve as a valuable source for the study of the biological characteristics of these two SC phenotypes and their roles in nerve‐specific regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Whole‐brain efferent and afferent connectivity of mouse ventral tegmental area melanocortin‐3 receptor neurons&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/258ce0b6-3c19-4d26-a19c-aa84f56eb39e/cne25013-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–VTA MC3R neurons are a likely site of interaction between homeostatic and hedonic feeding circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–VTA MC3R neurons send efferent projections to, and receive afferent input from, multiple brain regions involved in feeding, reward, and aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–Very few POMC and AgRP neurons were labeled by monosynaptic rabies from multiple VTA neuron subtypes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mesolimbic dopamine system is involved in the regulation of multiple behaviors, including feeding, and evidence demonstrates that the melanocortin system can act on the mesolimbic dopamine system to control feeding and other behaviors. The melanocortin‐3 receptor (MC3R) is an important component of the melanocortin system, but its overall role is poorly understood. Because MC3Rs are highly expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and are likely to be the key interaction point between the melanocortin and mesolimbic dopamine systems, we set out to identify both the efferent projection patterns of VTA MC3R neurons and the location of the neurons providing afferent input to them. VTA MC3R neurons were broadly connected to neurons across the brain but were strongly connected to a discrete set of brain regions involved in the regulation of feeding, reward, and aversion. Surprisingly, experiments using monosynaptic rabies virus showed that proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti‐related protein (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus made few direct synapses onto VTA MC3R neurons or any of the other major neuronal subtypes in the VTA, despite being extensively labeled by general retrograde tracers injected into the VTA. These results greatly contribute to our understanding of the anatomical interactions between the melanocortin and mesolimbic systems and provide a foundation for future studies of VTA MC3R neurons and the circuits containing them in the control of feeding and other behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Vector Space Model for Neural Network Functions: Inspirations From Similarities Between the Theory of Connectivity and the Logarithmic Time Course of Word Production</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present report examines the coinciding results of two study groups each presenting a power-of-two function to describe network structures underlying perceptual processes in one case and word production during verbal fluency tasks in the other. The former is theorized as neural cliques organized according to the function N = 2&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; − 1, whereas the latter assumes word conglomerations thinkable as tuples following the function N = 2&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;. Both theories assume the innate optimization of energy efficiency to cause the specific connectivity structure. The vast resemblance between both formulae motivated the development of a common formulation. This was obtained by using a vector space model, in which the configuration of neural cliques or connected words is represented by a N-dimensional state vector. A further analysis of the model showed that the entire time course of word production could be derived using basically one single minimal transformation-matrix. This again seems in line with the principle of maximum energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Dendritic Spine Plasticity: Function and Mechanisms</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spines are small protrusions studding neuronal dendrites, first described in 1888 by Ramón y Cajal using his famous Golgi stainings. Around 50 years later the advance of electron microscopy (EM) confirmed Cajal’s intuition that spines constitute the postsynaptic site of most excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain. The finding that spine density decreases between young and adult ages in fixed tissues suggested that spines are dynamic. It is only a decade ago that two-photon microscopy (TPM) has unambiguously proven the dynamic nature of spines, through the repeated imaging of single spines in live animals. Spine dynamics comprise formation, disappearance, and stabilization of spines and are modulated by neuronal activity and developmental age. Here, we review several emerging concepts in the field that start to answer the following key questions: What are the external signals triggering spine dynamics and the molecular mechanisms involved? What is, in return, the role of spine dynamics in circuit-rewiring, learning, and neuropsychiatric disorders?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Dystroglycan Mediates Clustering of Essential GABAergic Components in Cerebellar Purkinje Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Muscle dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC) links the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. In neurons, dystroglycan and dystrophin, two major components of the DGC, localize in a subset of GABAergic synapses, where their function is unclear. Here we used mouse models to analyze the specific role of the DGC in the organization and function of inhibitory synapses. Loss of full-length dystrophin in mdx mice resulted in a selective depletion of the transmembrane β-dystroglycan isoform from inhibitory post-synaptic sites in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Remarkably, there were no differences in the synaptic distribution of the extracellular α-dystroglycan subunit, of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and neuroligin 2. In contrast, conditional deletion of the dystroglycan gene from Purkinje cells caused a disruption of the DGC and severely impaired post-synaptic clustering of neuroligin 2, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and scaffolding proteins. Accordingly, whole-cell patch-clamp analysis revealed a significant reduction in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous IPSCs recorded from Purkinje cells. In the long-term, deletion of dystroglycan resulted in a significant decrease of GABAergic innervation of Purkinje cells and caused an impairment of motor learning functions. These results show that dystroglycan is an essential synaptic organizer at GABAergic synapses in Purkinje cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The TOR Pathway at the Neuromuscular Junction: More Than a Metabolic Player?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the chemical synapse connecting motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers. NMJs allow all voluntary movements, and ensure vital functions like breathing. Changes in the structure and function of NMJs are hallmarks of numerous pathological conditions that affect muscle function including sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the morphological and functional perturbations in the pre- and post-synaptic compartments of the NMJ remain poorly understood. Here, we discuss the role of the metabolic pathway associated to the kinase TOR (Target of Rapamycin) in the development, maintenance and alterations of the NMJ. This is of particular interest as the TOR pathway has been implicated in aging, but its role at the NMJ is still ill-defined. We highlight the respective functions of the two TOR-associated complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, and discuss the role of localized protein synthesis and autophagy regulation in motor neuron terminals and sub-synaptic regions of muscle fibers and their possible effects on NMJ maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Loss of Long-Term Potentiation at Hippocampal Output Synapses in Experimental Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) show severe problems in hippocampus dependent memory consolidation. Memory consolidation strongly depends on an intact dialog between the hippocampus and neocortical structures. Deficits in hippocampal signal transmission are known to provoke disturbances in memory formation. In the present study, we investigate changes of synaptic plasticity at hippocampal output structures in an experimental animal model of TLE. In pilocarpine-treated rats, we found suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal and parahippocampal regions such as the subiculum and the entorhinal cortex (EC). Subsequently we focused on the subiculum, serving as the major relay station between the hippocampus proper and downstream structures. In control animals, subicular pyramidal cells express different forms of LTP depending on their intrinsic firing pattern. In line with our extracellular recordings, we could show that LTP could only be induced in a minority of subicular pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate that a well-characterized cAMP-dependent signaling pathway involved in presynaptic forms of LTP is perturbed in pilocarpine-treated animals. Our findings suggest that in TLE, disturbances of synaptic plasticity may influence the information flow between the hippocampus and the neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Constant Levels of Tau Phosphorylation in the Brain of htau Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excessive tau phosphorylation is the hallmark of tauopathies. Today’s research thus focusses on the development of drugs targeting this pathological feature. To test new drugs in preclinical studies, animal models are needed that properly mimic this pathological hallmark. The htau mouse is a well-known model expressing human but lacking murine tau, allowing to evaluate the efficacy of tau modifying compounds without interference from murine tau. Htau mice are well-characterized for tau pathology at older age, although it is often not specified on which genetic background analyzed animals were bred. Since it was shown that the genetic background can influence the pathology, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of young and adult htau mice on a C57BL/6J background by analyzing ptau Ser202 and ptau Ser396 levels in the cortex and hippocampus of 3 and 12 month old animals by immunofluorescent labelling. Additionally, we evaluated total tau, ptau Thr231 and ptau Thr181 in the soluble and insoluble brain fraction of 3–15 month old htau mice by immunosorbent assay. Our results show that ptau levels of all analyzed residues and age groups are similar without strong increases over age. These data show that tau is already phosphorylated at the age of 3 months suggesting that phosphorylation starts even earlier. The early start of tau phosphorylation in htau mice enables the use of these mice for efficacy studies already at very young age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Altered Static and Dynamic Spontaneous Neural Activity in Drug-Naïve and Drug-Receiving Benign Childhood Epilepsy With Centrotemporal Spikes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present study aims to investigate intrinsic abnormalities of brain and the effect of antiepileptic treatment on brain activity in Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS). Twenty-six drug-naïve patients (DNP) and 22 drug-receiving patients (DRP) with BECTS were collected in this study. Static amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (sALFF) and dynamic ALFF (dALFF) were applied to resting-state fMRI data. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis was further performed for affected regions identified by static and dynamic analysis. One-way analysis of variance and post hoc statistical analyses were performed for between-group differences. Abnormal sALFF and dALFF values were correlated with clinical features of patients. Compared with healthy controls (HC), DNP group demonstrated alterations of sALFF and/or dALFF in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), supplementary motor areas (SMA), cerebellum, hippocampus, pallidum and cingulate cortex, in which the values were close to normal in DRP. Notably, sALFF and dALFF showed specific sensitivity in detecting abnormalities in basal ganglia and cerebellum. Additionally, DRP showed additional changes in precuneus, inferior temporal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and occipital visual cortex. Compared with HC, the DNP showed increased FC in default network and motion-related networks, and the DRP showed decreased FC in default network. The MPFC, hippocampus, SMA, basal ganglia and cerebellum are indicated to be intrinsically affected regions and effective therapeutic targets. And the FC profiles of default and motion-related networks might be potential core indicators for clinical treatment. This study revealed potential neuromodulatory targets and helped understand pathomechanism of BECTS. Static and dynamic analyses should be combined to investigate neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Focus on the Breath: Brain Decoding Reveals Internal States of Attention During Meditation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00336</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00336</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Meditation practices are often used to cultivate interoception or internally-oriented attention to bodily sensations, which may improve health via cognitive and emotional regulation of bodily signals. However, it remains unclear how meditation impacts internal attention (IA) states due to lack of measurement tools that can objectively assess mental states during meditation practice itself, and produce time estimates of internal focus at individual or group levels. To address these measurement gaps, we tested the feasibility of applying multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to single-subject fMRI data to: (1) learn and recognize internal attentional states relevant for meditation during a directed IA task; and (2) decode or estimate the presence of those IA states during an independent meditation session. Within a mixed sample of experienced meditators and novice controls (N = 16), we first used MVPA to develop single-subject brain classifiers for five modes of attention during an IA task in which subjects were specifically instructed to engage in one of five states [i.e., meditation-related states: breath attention, mind wandering (MW), and self-referential processing, and control states: attention to feet and sounds]. Using standard cross-validation procedures, MVPA classifiers were trained in five of six IA blocks for each subject, and predictive accuracy was tested on the independent sixth block (iterated until all volumes were tested, N = 2,160). Across participants, all five IA states were significantly recognized well above chance (&amp;gt;41% vs. 20% chance). At the individual level, IA states were recognized in most participants (87.5%), suggesting that recognition of IA neural patterns may be generalizable for most participants, particularly experienced meditators. Next, for those who showed accurate IA neural patterns, the originally trained classifiers were applied to a separate meditation run (10-min) to make an inference about the percentage time engaged in each IA state (breath attention, MW, or self-referential processing). Preliminary group-level analyses demonstrated that during meditation practice, participants spent more time attending to breath compared to MW or self-referential processing. This paradigm established the feasibility of using MVPA classifiers to objectively assess mental states during meditation at the participant level, which holds promise for improved measurement of internal attention states cultivated by meditation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Correlates of Group Versus Individual Problem Solving Revealed by fMRI</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Group problem solving is a prototypical complex collective intellectual activity. Psychological research provides compelling evidence that problem solving in groups is both qualitatively and quantitatively different from doing so alone. However, the question of whether individual and collective problem solving involve the same neural substrate has not yet been addressed, mainly due to methodological limitations. In the current study, functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed to compare brain activation when participants solved Raven-like matrix problems in a small group and individually. In the group condition, the participant in the scanner was able to discuss the problem with other team members using a special communication device. In the individual condition, the participant was required to think aloud while solving the problem in the silent presence of the other team members. Greater activation was found in several brain regions during group problem solving, including the medial prefrontal cortex; lateral parietal, cingulate, precuneus and retrosplenial cortices; frontal and temporal poles. These areas have been identified as potential components of the so-called “social brain” on the basis of research using offline judgments of material related to socializing. Therefore, this study demonstrated the actual involvement of these regions in real-time social interactions, such as group problem solving. However, further connectivity analysis revealed that the social brain components are co-activated, but do not increase their coupling during cooperation as would be suggested for a holistic network. We suggest that the social mode of the brain may be described instead as a re-configuration of connectivity between basic networks, and we found decreased connectivity between the language and salience networks in the group compared to the individual condition. A control experiment showed that the findings from the main experiment cannot be entirely accounted for by discourse comprehension. Thus, the study demonstrates affordances provided by the presented new technique for neuroimaging the “group mind,” implementing the single-brain version of the second-person neuroscience approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Transition of Neural Activity From the Chaotic Bipolar-Disorder State to the Periodic Healthy State Using External Feedback Signals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronotherapy is a treatment for mood disorders, including major depressive disorder, mania, and bipolar disorder (BD). Neurotransmitters associated with the pathology of mood disorders exhibit circadian rhythms. A functional deficit in the neural circuits related to mood disorders disturbs the circadian rhythm; chronotherapy is an intervention that helps resynchronize the patient's biological clock with the periodic daily cycle, leading to amelioration of symptoms. In previous reports, Hadaeghi et al. proposed a non-linear dynamic model composed of the frontal and sensory cortical neural networks and the hypothalamus to explain the relationship between deficits in neural function in the frontal cortex and the disturbed circadian rhythm/mood transitions in BD (hereinafter referred to as the Hadaeghi model). In this model, neural activity in the frontal and sensory lobes exhibits periodic behavior in the healthy state; while in BD, this neural activity is in a state of chaos-chaos intermittency; this temporal departure from the healthy periodic state disturbs the circadian pacemaker in the hypothalamus. In this study, we propose an intervention based on a feedback method called the “reduced region of orbit” (RRO) method to facilitate the transition of the disturbed frontal cortical neural activity underlying BD to healthy periodic activity. Our simulation was based on the Hadaeghi model. We used an RRO feedback signal based on the return-map structure of the simulated frontal and sensory lobes to induce synchronization with a relatively weak periodic signal corresponding to the healthy condition by applying feedback of appropriate strength. The RRO feedback signal induces chaotic resonance, which facilitates the transition to healthy, periodic frontal neural activity, although this synchronization is restricted to a relatively low frequency of the periodic input signal. Additionally, applying an appropriate strength of the RRO feedback signal lowered the amplitude of the periodic input signal required to induce a synchronous state compared with the periodic signal applied alone. In conclusion, through a chaotic-resonance effect induced by the RRO feedback method, the state of the disturbed frontal neural activity characteristic of BD was transformed into a state close to healthy periodic activity by relatively weak periodic perturbations. Thus, RRO feedback-modulated chronotherapy might be an innovative new type of minimally invasive chronotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Generation of neuronal diversity is a biological strategy widely used in the brain to process complex information. The olfactory bulb is the first relay station of olfactory information in the vertebrate central nervous system. In the olfactory bulb, axons of the olfactory sensory neurons form synapses with dendrites of projection neurons that transmit the olfactory information to the olfactory cortex. Historically, the olfactory bulb projection neurons have been classified into two populations, mitral cells and tufted cells. The somata of these cells are distinctly segregated within the layers of the olfactory bulb; the mitral cells are located in the mitral cell layer while the tufted cells are found in the external plexiform layer. Although mitral and tufted cells share many morphological, biophysical, and molecular characteristics, they differ in soma size, projection patterns of their dendrites and axons, and odor responses. In addition, tufted cells are further subclassified based on the relative depth of their somata location in the external plexiform layer. Evidence suggests that different types of tufted cells have distinct cellular properties and play different roles in olfactory information processing. Therefore, mitral and different types of tufted cells are considered as starting points for parallel pathways of olfactory information processing in the brain. Moreover, recent studies suggest that mitral cells also consist of heterogeneous subpopulations with different cellular properties despite the fact that the mitral cell layer is a single-cell layer. In this review, we first compare the morphology of projection neurons in the olfactory bulb of different vertebrate species. Next, we explore the similarities and differences among subpopulations of projection neurons in the rodent olfactory bulb. We also discuss the timing of neurogenesis as a factor for the generation of projection neuron heterogeneity in the olfactory bulb. Knowledge about the subpopulations of olfactory bulb projection neurons will contribute to a better understanding of the complex olfactory information processing in higher brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Immune Factor, TNFα, Disrupts Human Brain Organoid Development Similar to Schizophrenia—Schizophrenia Increases Developmental Vulnerability to TNFα</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00233</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia (SZ) is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder in which maternal immune activation (MIA) and increased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) may contribute. Previous studies using iPSC-derived cerebral organoids and neuronal cells demonstrated developmental malformation and transcriptional dysregulations, including TNF receptors and their signaling genes, common to SZ patients with diverse genetic backgrounds. In the present study, we examined the significance of the common TNF receptor dysregulations by transiently exposing cerebral organoids from embryonic stem cells (ESC) and from representative control and SZ patient iPSCs to TNF. In control iPSC organoids, TNF produced malformations qualitatively similar in, but generally less pronounced than, the malformations of the SZ iPSC-derived organoids. TNF and SZ alone disrupted subcortical rosettes and dispersed proliferating Ki67&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neural progenitor cells (NPC) from the organoid ventricular zone (VZ) into the cortical zone (CZ). In the CZ, the absence of large ramified pan-Neu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons coincided with loss of myelinated neurites despite increased cortical accumulation of O4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligodendrocytes. The number of calretinin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons increased; however, they lacked the preferential parallel orientation to the organoid surface. SZ and SZ+TNF affected fine cortical and subcortical organoid structure by replacing cells with extracellular matrix (ECM)-like fibers The SZ condition increased developmental vulnerability to TNF, leading to more pronounced changes in NPC, pan-Neu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, and interneurons. Both SZ- and TNF-induced malformations were associated with the loss of nuclear (n)FGFR1 form in the CZ and its upregulation in deep IZ regions, while in earlier studies blocking nFGFR1 reproduced cortical malformations observed in SZ. Computational analysis of ChiPseq and RNAseq datasets shows that nFGFR1 directly targets neurogenic, oligodendrogenic, cell migration, and ECM genes, and that the FGFR1-targeted TNF receptor and signaling genes are overexpressed in SZ NPC. Through these changes, the developing brain with the inherited SZ genome dysregulation may suffer increased vulnerability to TNF and thus, MIA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Pilot Investigation: Older Adults With Atrial Fibrillation Demonstrate Greater Brain Leukoaraiosis in Infracortical and Deep Regions Relative to Non-Atrial Fibrillation Peers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00271</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00271</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;This pilot study explored differences in distribution of white matter hyperintensities (called leukoaraiosis; LA) in older adults (mean age = 67 years) with atrial fibrillation (AF) vs. non-AF peers measured by: (1) depth distribution; (2) anterior-posterior distribution; (3) associations between LA and cortical thickness; and (4) presence of lacunae and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Participant data (AF n = 17; non-AF peers n = 17) were acquired with the same magnetic resonance imaging protocols. LA volume was quantified by cortical depth (periventricular, deep, infracortical) and in anterior and posterior regions. Cortical thickness by lobe was assessed relative to LA load.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Relative to non-AF peers, the AF group had twice the total LA volume (AF = 2.1% vs. Non-AF = 0.9%), over 10 times greater infracortical LA (AF = 0.72% vs. Non-AF = 0.07%), and three times greater deep LA (AF = 2.1% vs. Non-AF = 0.6%). Examinations of the extent of LA in anterior vs. posterior regions revealed a trend for more posterior relative to anterior LA. In the entire sample, total LA and infracortical LA were negatively associated with temporal lobe thickness. Only those with AF presented with lacunae or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Aging adults with AF had more total white matter disease than those without AF, particularly near the cortical mantle and deep within the cortex. Total and infracortical white matter disease in the entire sample negatively associated with temporal lobe thickness. Results suggest that those with AF have a distinct pattern of LA relative to those without AF, and that LA severity for all individuals may associate with structural changes in the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Relationship of Parieto-Occipital Brain Energy Phosphate Metabolism and Cognition Using 31P MRS at 7-Tesla in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The human brain has high energy requirements that continuously support healthy neuronal activity and cognition. A disruption in brain energy metabolism (BEM) may contribute to early neuropathological changes such as accumulation of β-amyloid and tau in vulnerable populations. One such population is amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) where some individuals are at risk for developing dementia, i.e. Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent advances in imaging technology are providing new avenues to measure BEM accurately using 31phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) at ultra-high-field (UHF) magnetic strength 7-Tesla. This study investigates whether a methodology using partial volume-coil 31P MRS at 7T over parieto-occipital lobes can accurately quantify high-energy phosphate and membrane phospholipid metabolites in aMCI. A secondary objective was to explore BEM and membrane phospholipid indices’ correspondence with cognitive performance in domains of executive function (EF), memory, attention, and visuospatial skills in aMCI, a heterogeneous population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;19 aMCI participants enrolled in the study completed cognitive assessment and 31P MRS scan. BEM indices were measured using three energy indicators: energy reserve (PCr/t-ATP), energy consumption (intracellular_Pi/t-ATP), and metabolic state (PCr/intracellular_Pi) along with regulatory co-factors of BEM-intracellular Mg&lt;sup&gt;2 + &lt;/sup&gt; and pH; whereas the ratio of phosphomonoesters (PMEs) to phosphodiesters (PDEs) – membrane phospholipid indicator.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;31P MRS scan showed thirteen well-resolved peaks with precise quantification of the phosphorus metabolites at UHF. The higher BEM indices were associated with lower cognitive performance of memory [(energy reserve indicator: CVLT p = 0.004), (metabolic state indicator: CVLT p = 0.007)], executive function [(metabolic state indicator: TOSL (p = 0.044)], and attention [(pH: selective auditory task, p = 0.044)]. The finding of an inverse relationship observed in the parieto-occipital lobes suggests an association between neuronal energy markers with cognition in aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The significant contribution of this preliminary research was to establish the feasibility of utilizing a methodology at UHF to accurately measure high-energy phosphate and membrane phospholipid metabolites in a population with heterogeneous outcomes. This work offers a novel approach for future work to further elucidate early dementia biomarkers or precursors to the downstream accumulation of amyloid and tau using the combination of MRS-PET imaging modalities in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Cell migration through a three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix (ECM) underlies important physiological phenomena and is based on a variety of mechanical strategies depending on the cell type and the properties of the ECM. By using computer simulations of the cell’s mid-plane, we investigate two such migration mechanisms—‘push-pull’ (forming a finger-like protrusion, adhering to an ECM node, and pulling the cell body forward) and ‘rear-squeezing’ (pushing the cell body through the ECM by contracting the cell cortex and ECM at the cell rear). We present a computational model that accounts for both elastic deformation and forces of the ECM, an active cell cortex and nucleus, and for hydrodynamic forces and flow of the extracellular fluid, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm. We find that relations between three mechanical parameters—the cortex’s contractile force, nuclear elasticity, and ECM rigidity—determine the effectiveness of cell migration through the dense ECM. The cell can migrate persistently even if its cortical contraction cannot deform a near-rigid ECM, but then the contraction of the cortex has to be able to sufficiently deform the nucleus. The cell can also migrate even if it fails to deform a stiff nucleus, but then it has to be able to sufficiently deform the ECM. Simulation results show that nuclear stiffness limits the cell migration more than the ECM rigidity. Simulations show the rear-squeezing mechanism of motility results in more robust migration with larger cell displacements than those with the push-pull mechanism over a range of parameter values. Additionally, results show that the rear-squeezing mechanism is aided by hydrodynamics through a pressure gradient.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0LW-rCLTGRs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Buildup and bistability in auditory streaming as an evidence accumulation process with saturation</title>

A repeating triplet-sequence &lt;i&gt;ABA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; of non-overlapping brief tones, &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, is a valued paradigm for studying auditory stream formation and the cocktail party problem. The stimulus is “heard” either as a galloping pattern (integration) or as two interleaved streams (segregation); the initial percept is typically integration then followed by spontaneous alternations between segregation and integration, each being dominant for a few seconds. The probability of segregation grows over seconds, from near-zero to a steady value, defining the buildup function, BUF. Its stationary level increases with the difference in tone frequencies, &lt;i&gt;DF&lt;/i&gt;, and the BUF rises faster. Percept durations have &lt;i&gt;DF&lt;/i&gt;-dependent means and are gamma-like distributed. Behavioral and computational studies usually characterize triplet streaming either during alternations or during buildup. Here, our experimental design and modeling encompass both. We propose a pseudo-neuromechanistic model that incorporates spiking activity in primary auditory cortex, A1, as input and resolves perception along two network-layers downstream of A1. Our model is straightforward and intuitive. It describes the noisy accumulation of evidence against the current percept which generates switches when reaching a threshold. Accumulation can saturate either above or below threshold; if below, the switching dynamics resemble noise-induced transitions from an attractor state. Our model accounts quantitatively for three key features of data: the BUFs, mean durations, and normalized dominance duration distributions, at various &lt;i&gt;DF&lt;/i&gt; values. It describes perceptual alternations without competition per se, and underscores that treating triplets in the sequence independently and averaging across trials, as implemented in earlier widely cited studies, is inadequate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1vsFHX6bz5M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Determining the interaction status and evolutionary fate of duplicated homomeric proteins</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008145</guid>

Oligomeric proteins are central to life. Duplication and divergence of their genes is a key evolutionary driver, also because duplications can yield very different outcomes. Given a homomeric ancestor, duplication can yield two paralogs that form two distinct homomeric complexes, or a heteromeric complex comprising both paralogs. Alternatively, one paralog remains a homomer while the other acquires a new partner. However, so far, conflicting trends have been noted with respect to which fate dominates, primarily because different methods and criteria are being used to assign the interaction status of paralogs. Here, we systematically analyzed all &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; oligomeric complexes that include paralogous proteins. We found that the proportions of homo-hetero duplication fates strongly depend on a variety of factors, yet that nonetheless, rigorous filtering gives a consistent picture. In &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; about 50%, of the paralogous pairs appear to have retained the ancestral homomeric interaction, whereas in &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; only ~10% retained a homomeric state. This difference was also observed when unique complexes were counted instead of paralogous gene pairs. We further show that this difference is accounted for by multiple cases of heteromeric yeast complexes that share common ancestry with homomeric bacterial complexes. Our analysis settles contradicting trends and conflicting previous analyses, and provides a systematic and rigorous pipeline for delineating the fate of duplicated oligomers in any organism for which protein-protein interaction data are available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MC0alpuNUGM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic challenged universities and other academic institutions to rapidly adapt to urgent and life-threatening situations. It forced most institutions to shut down nearly every aspect of their research and educational enterprises. In doing so, university leaders were thrust into unchartered waters and forced them to make unprecedented decisions. Successes and failures along the way highlighted how the autonomous nature of the American academic research enterprise and skillsets normally required of university leaders were ill-suited to mounting an emergency response. Here, as faculty from medical centers in the United States, we draw lessons from these experiences and apply them as we plan for the next possible COVID-19-induced shutdown as well as other large-scale pandemics and emergencies at universities in the United States and throughout the world.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OVez8-R12xM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Effects of IgLON5 Antibodies on Neuronal Cytoskeleton: A Link between Autoimmunity and Neurodegeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anti‐IgLON5 disease is a neurological disorder characterized by autoantibodies against IgLON5 and pathological evidence of neuronal‐specific tau accumulation. Here, we report that patients' IgLON5 IgG, but not other cell‐surface antibodies, disrupt the cytoskeletal organization in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, resulting in dystrophic neurites and axonal swelling. Adsorption of IgLON5 IgG with HEK293 cells expressing IgLON5 abrogated the indicated cytoskeletal changes. These findings, along with an increase of levels of neurofilaments in patients' cerebrospinal fluid, suggest that IgLON5 IgG, unlike other cell‐surface antibodies, disrupts neuronal cytoskeleton maintenance, providing a link between autoimmunity and neurodegeneration.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mechanisms underlying the enhancement of γ‐aminobutyric acid responses in the external globus pallidus of R6/2 Huntington’s disease model mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/338add39-cd22-49a2-a6d2-91cb48400c6c/jnr24710-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses evoked by selective stimulation of indirect pathway striatal neurons are increased in the external globus pallidus (GPe) of R6/2 mice. Using electrophysiology, optogenetics, immunohistochemistry and Western blots we demonstrate that GABA transporter, GAT‐3 function is reduced. This could explain increased decay time of evoked responses in the GPe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Huntington's disease (HD), the output of striatal indirect pathway medium‐sized spiny neurons (MSNs) is altered in its target region, the external globus pallidus (GPe). In a previous study we demonstrated that selective optogenetic stimulation of indirect pathway MSNs induced prolonged decay time of γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses in GPe neurons. Here we identified the mechanism underlying this alteration. Electrophysiological recordings in slices from symptomatic R6/2 and wildtype (WT) mice were used to evaluate, primarily, the effects of GABA transporter (GAT) antagonists on responses evoked by optogenetic activation of indirect pathway MSNs. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blots (WBs) were used to examine GAT‐3 expression in HD and WT mice. A GAT‐3 blocker (SNAP5114) increased decay time of GABA responses in WT and HD GPe neurons, but the effect was significantly greater in WT neurons. In contrast, a GAT‐1 antagonist (NO‐711) or a GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist (CGP 54626) produced small increases in decay time but no differential effects between genotypes. IHC and WBs showed reduction of GAT‐3 expression in the GPe of HD mice. Thus, reduced expression or dysfunction of GAT‐3 could underlie alterations of GPe responses to GABA inputs from striatum and could be a target for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate 3‐kinase (PI3K) complex have been associated with a broad spectrum of brain and organ overgrowth syndromes. For example, mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐3‐kinase regulatory subunit 2 (&lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt;) have been identified in patients with megalencephaly‐polymicrogyria‐polydactyly‐hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome, which includes brain overgrowth. To better understand the pathogenesis of &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; related mutations, we have developed and characterized a murine model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generated a knock‐in mouse model for the most common human &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutation, p.G373R (p.G367R in mice) using CRISPR/Cas9. The mouse phenotypes, including brain size, seizure activity, cortical lamination, cell proliferation/size/density, interneuron migration, and PI3K pathway activation were analyzed using standard methodologies. For patients with &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, clinical data (OFC and epilepsy) were retrospectively obtained from our clinical records (published/unpublished).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PI3K‐AKT pathway was hyperactivated in these mice, confirming the p.G367R mutation is an activating mutation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Similar to patients with &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, these mice have enlarged brains. We found cell size to be increased but not cell numbers. The embryonic brain showed mild defects in cortical lamination, although not observed in the mature brain. Furthermore, EEG recordings from mutant mice showed background slowing and rare seizures, again similar to our observations in patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have generated a &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mouse model that exhibits megalencephaly and EEG changes, both of which overlap with human patients. Our data provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of the human disease caused by PIK3R2 p.G373R mutation. We anticipate this model will be valuable in testing therapeutic options for MPPH patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: A Critical LRRK at the Synapse? The Neurobiological Function and Pathophysiological Dysfunction of LRRK2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00153</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since the discovery of LRRK2 mutations causal to Parkinson’s disease (PD) in the early 2000s, the LRRK2 protein has been implicated in a plethora of cellular processes in which pathogenesis could occur, yet its physiological function remains elusive. The development of genetic models of LRRK2 PD has helped identify the etiological and pathophysiological underpinnings of the disease, and may identify early points of intervention. An important role for LRRK2 in synaptic function has emerged in recent years, which links LRRK2 to other genetic forms of PD, most notably those caused by mutations in the synaptic protein α-synuclein. This point of convergence may provide useful clues as to what drives dysfunction in the basal ganglia circuitry and eventual death of substantia nigra (SN) neurons. Here, we discuss the evolution and current state of the literature placing LRRK2 at the synapse, through the lens of knock-out, overexpression, and knock-in animal models. We hope that a deeper understanding of LRRK2 neurobiology, at the synapse and beyond, will aid the eventual development of neuroprotective interventions for PD, and the advancement of useful treatments in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: AAV-Delivered Tulp1 Supplementation Therapy Targeting Photoreceptors Provides Minimal Benefit in Tulp1−/− Retinas</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00891</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With marketing approval of the first ocular gene therapy, and other gene therapies in clinical trial, treatments for inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) have become a reality. Biallelic mutations in the tubby like protein 1 gene (TULP1) are causative of IRDs in humans; a mouse knock-out model (Tulp1−/−) is characterized by a similar disease phenotype. We developed a Tulp1 supplementation therapy for Tulp1−/− mice. Utilizing subretinal AAV2/5 delivery at postnatal day (p)2–3 and rhodopsin-kinase promoter (GRK1P) we targeted Tulp1 to photoreceptor cells exploring three doses, 2.2E9, 3.7E8, and 1.2E8 vgs. Tulp1 mRNA and TULP1 protein were assessed by RT-qPCR, western blot and immunocytochemistry, and visual function by electroretinography. Our results indicate that TULP1 was expressed in photoreceptors; achieved levels of Tulp1 mRNA and protein were similar to wild type levels at p20. However, the thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) did not improve in treated Tulp1−/− mice. There was a small and transient electroretinography benefit in the treated retinas at 4 weeks of age (not observed by 6 weeks) when using 3.7E8 vg dose. Dark-adapted mixed rod and cone a- and b-wave amplitudes were 24.3 ± 13.5 μV and 52.2 ± 31.7 μV in treated Tulp1−/− mice, which were significantly different (p &amp;lt; 0.001, t-test), from those detected in untreated eyes (7.1 ± 7.0 μV and 9.4 ± 15.1 μV, respectively). Our results indicate that Tulp1 supplementation in photoreceptors may not be sufficient to provide robust benefit in Tulp1−/− mice. As such, further studies are required to fine tune the Tulp1 supplementation therapy, which, in principle, should rescue the Tulp1−/− phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: T Cell Responses to Neural Autoantigens Are Similar in Alzheimer’s Disease Patients and Age-Matched Healthy Controls</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a chronic multifactorial and complex neurodegenerative disorder is a leading cause of dementia. Recently, neuroinflammation has been hypothesized as a contributing factor to AD pathogenesis. The role of adaptive immune responses against neuronal antigens, which can either confer protection or induce damage in AD, has not been fully characterized. Here, we measured T cell responses to several potential antigens of neural origin including amyloid precursor protein (APP), amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, α-synuclein, and transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43) in patients with AD and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Antigen-specific T cell reactivity was detected for all tested antigens, and response to tau-derived epitopes was particularly strong, but no significant differences between individuals with AD and age-matched HC were identified. We also did not observe any correlation between the antigen-specific T cell responses and clinical variables including age, gender, years since diagnosis and cognitive score. Additionally, further characterization did not reveal any differences in the relative frequency of major Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) subsets, or in the expression of genes between AD patients and HC. These observations have not identified a key role of neuronal antigen-specific T cell responses in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effects of Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Sleep Time and Efficiency</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00357</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00357</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A single session of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to increase arousal in healthy participants for up to 24 h post-stimulation. However, little is known about the effects of tDCS on subsequent sleep in this population. Based on previous clinical studies, we hypothesized that anodal stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) would produce higher arousal with decreased sleep time and stimulation to the primary motor cortex (M1) would have the converse effect. Thirty-six active duty military were randomized into one of three groups (n = 12/group); active anodal tDCS over the lDLPFC, active anodal tDCS over left M1, or sham tDCS. Participants answered questionnaires 3 times a day and wore a wrist activity monitor (WAM) to measure sleep time and efficiency for 3 weeks. On weeks 2 and 3 (order counterbalance), participants received stimulation at 1800 h before 26 h of sustained wakefulness testing (sleep deprived) and at 1800 h without sleep deprivation (non-sleep deprived). There were no significant effects for the non-sleep deprived portion of testing. For the sleep deprived portion of testing, there were main effects of group and night on sleep time. The DLPFC group slept less than the other groups on the second and third night following stimulation. There is no negative effect on mood or sleep quality from a single dose of tDCS when participants have normal sleep patterns (i.e., non-sleep deprived portion of testing). The results suggest that stimulation may result in faster recovery from fatigue caused by acute periods of sleep deprivation, as their recovery sleep periods were less.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Association Between Amygdala Subfield-Related Functional Connectivity and Stigma Reduction 12 Months After Social Contacts: A Functional Neuroimaging Study in a Subgroup of a Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00356</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00356</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social contact is one of the best methods for reducing stigma, and the effect may be associated with emotional response and social cognition. The amygdala is a key region of these functions and can be divided into three subregions, each of which has a different function and connectivity. We investigated whether the amygdala subregion-related functional connectivity is associated with the effect of anti-stigma interventions on reducing mental health-related stigma in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) over 12 months. Healthy young adults [n = 77, age, mean (SD) = 21.23 (0.94) years; male, n = 48], who were subsampled from an RCT (n = 259) investigating the effect of anti-stigma interventions, using filmed social contacts (FSC) or internet self-learning (INS), on reducing stigma, underwent 10 min resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging between the trial registration and 12 months follow-up. The extent of stigma was assessed at the baseline, post-intervention and 12 month follow-up surveys, using the Japanese-language version of the Social Distance Scale (SDSJ), to assess negative emotional attitude toward people with schizophrenia. We compared associations between amygdala subregion-related functional connectivity and changes in the SDSJ scores for 12 months across the control, INS, and FSC groups. Associations between the change in stigma for 12 months and the superficial (SF) subregion of the amygdala-related connectivity in the intracalcarine cortex [(x, y, z) = (−8, −66, 12), z = 4.21, P&lt;sub&gt;FWE–corrected&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0003, cluster size = 192] differed across groups. The post hoc analysis showed that the SF–intracalcarine cortex connectivity was negatively correlated with the change in stigma only in the FSC group. The current results indicate that greater SF–intracalcarine cortex connectivity is associated with a better response to the FSC interventions, suggesting that biological variability could underlie the long-term effect of anti-stigma interventions on stigma in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Immediate Effects of Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Postural Stability Using Computerized Dynamic Posturography in People With Chronic Post-stroke Hemiparesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00341</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00341</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Postural stability is commonly decreased in individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis due to multisystemic deficits. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method to modulate cortical excitability, inducing neuroplastic changes to the targeted cortical areas and has been suggested to potentially improve motor functions in individuals with neurological impairments. The purpose of this double-blinded, sham-controlled study was to examine the acute effects of anodal tDCS over the lesioned motor cortex leg area with concurrent limits of stability training on postural control in individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis. Ten individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis received either anodal or sham tDCS stimulation over the lesioned leg region of the motor cortex while undergoing 20 min of postural training. The type of stimulation to receive during the first session was pseudorandomized, and the two sessions were separated by 14 days. Before and immediately after 20 min of tDCS, the 10 m walk test, the Berg Balance Scale, and dynamic posturography assessments were performed. After a single session of anodal tDCS with concurrent postural training, we observed no changes in clinical measures of balance and walking, assessed using the Berg Balance Scale and 10 m walk test. For dynamic posturography assessments, participants demonstrated improvements in adaptation responses to toes-up and toes-down perturbations, regardless of the type of tDCS received. Additionally, improved performance in the shifting center of gravity was observed during anodal tDCS. Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest that tDCS can potentially be used as a feasible approach be incorporated into the rehabilitation of chronic post-stroke individuals with issues related to postural control and fear of falling, and that multiple sessions of tDCS stimulation may be needed to improve functional measures of postural control and walking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Gender Perception From Gait: A Comparison Between Biological, Biomimetic and Non-biomimetic Learning Paradigms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00320</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00320</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper explores in parallel the underlying mechanisms in human perception of biological motion and the best approaches for automatic classification of gait. The experiments tested three different learning paradigms, namely, biological, biomimetic, and non-biomimetic models for gender identification from human gait. Psychophysical experiments with twenty-one observers were conducted along with computational experiments without applying any gender specific modifications to the models or the stimuli. Results demonstrate the utilization of a generic memory based learning system in humans for gait perception, thus reducing ambiguity between two opposing learning systems proposed for biological motion perception. Results also support the biomimetic nature of memory based artificial neural networks (ANN) in their ability to emulate biological neural networks, as opposed to non-biomimetic models. In addition, the comparison between biological and computational learning approaches establishes a memory based biomimetic model as the best candidate for a generic artificial gait classifier (83% accuracy, p &amp;lt; 0.001), compared to human observers (66%, p &amp;lt; 0.005) or non-biomimetic models (83%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) while adhering to human-like sensitivity to gender identification, promising potential for application of the model in any given non-gender based gait perception objective with superhuman performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Neurophysiological Responses of Concussive Impacts: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00306</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00306</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aim: This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated neurophysiological responses using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) following a concussion or sub-concussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic searching of relevant databases for peer-reviewed literature quantifying motor evoked potentials from TMS between 1999 and 2019 was performed. A meta-analysis quantified pooled data for measures including motor threshold, motor latency, and motor evoked potential amplitude and for inhibitory measures such as cortical silent period duration, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies were arbitrarily classified into the groups, based on time post-concussion, “acute” (subjects 0–3 months post-injury, n = 8) and “post-acute” (3 months−2 years post-concussion, n = 7). A TMS quality of study checklist rated studies from moderate to high in methodological quality; however, the risk of bias analysis found that the included studies were categorised as high risk of bias, particularly for a lack of allocation concealment and blinding of participants in the methodologies. A meta-analysis showed no differences in excitability measures, apart from a decreased motor threshold that was observed in the concussed group (SMD −0.28, 95% CI −0.51 to −0.04; P = 0.02) for the post-acute time frame. Conversely, all inhibitory measures showed differences between groups. Cortical silent period duration was found to be significantly increased in the acute (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.58–1.81; P &amp;lt; 0.001) and post-acute (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.12–0.98; P = 0.01) time frames. The SICI (SMD −1.15, 95% CI −1.95 to −0.34; P = 0.005) and LICI (SMD −1.95, 95% CI −3.04 to −0.85; P = 0.005) ratios were reduced, inferring increased inhibition, for the post-acute time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that inhibitory pathways are affected in the acute period post-concussion. However, persistent alterations in cortical excitability remain, with increased intracortical inhibition. While TMS should be considered as a reliable technique to measure the functional integrity of the central nervous system, the high risk of bias and heterogeneity in data suggest that future studies should aim to incorporate standardised methodological techniques, particularly with threshold determination and stimulus intervals for paired-pulse measures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Inflamed Brain in Schizophrenia: The Convergence of Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors That Lead to Uncontrolled Neuroinflammation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a disorder with a heterogeneous etiology involving complex interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors. The immune system is now known to play vital roles in nervous system function and pathology through regulating neuronal and glial development, synaptic plasticity, and behavior. In this regard, the immune system is positioned as a common link between the seemingly diverse genetic and environmental risk factors for schizophrenia. Synthesizing information about how the immune-brain axis is affected by multiple factors and how these factors might interact in schizophrenia is necessary to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease. Such knowledge will aid in the development of more translatable animal models that may lead to effective therapeutic interventions. Here, we provide an overview of the genetic risk factors for schizophrenia that modulate immune function. We also explore environmental factors for schizophrenia including exposure to pollution, gut dysbiosis, maternal immune activation and early-life stress, and how the consequences of these risk factors are linked to microglial function and dysfunction. We also propose that morphological and signaling deficits of the blood-brain barrier, as observed in some individuals with schizophrenia, can act as a gateway between peripheral and central nervous system inflammation, thus affecting microglia in their essential functions. Finally, we describe the diverse roles that microglia play in response to neuroinflammation and their impact on brain development and homeostasis, as well as schizophrenia pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Primer on Constructing Plasticity Phenotypes to Classify Experience-Dependent Development of the Visual Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many neural mechanisms regulate experience-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex (V1), and new techniques for quantifying large numbers of proteins or genes are transforming how plasticity is studied into the era of big data. With those large data sets comes the challenge of extracting biologically meaningful results about visual plasticity from data-driven analytical methods designed for high-dimensional data. In other areas of neuroscience, high-information content methodologies are revealing more subtle aspects of neural development and individual variations that give rise to a richer picture of brain disorders. We have developed an approach for studying V1 plasticity that takes advantage of the known functions of many synaptic proteins for regulating visual plasticity. We use that knowledge to rebrand protein measurements into plasticity features and combine those into a plasticity phenotype. Here, we provide a primer for analyzing experience-dependent plasticity in V1 using example R code to identify high-dimensional changes in a group of proteins. We describe using PCA to classify high-dimensional plasticity features and use them to construct a plasticity phenotype. In the examples, we show how to use this analytical framework to study and compare experience-dependent development and plasticity of V1 and apply the plasticity phenotype to translational research questions. We include an R package “PlasticityPhenotypes” that aggregates the coding packages and custom code written in RStudio to construct and analyze plasticity phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Secreted Chaperones in Neurodegeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00268</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is a combination of cellular processes that govern protein quality control, namely, protein translation, folding, processing, and degradation. Disruptions in these processes can lead to protein misfolding and aggregation. Proteostatic disruption can lead to cellular changes such as endoplasmic reticulum or oxidative stress; organelle dysfunction; and, if continued, to cell death. A majority of neurodegenerative diseases involve the pathologic aggregation of proteins that subverts normal neuronal function. While prior reviews of neuronal proteostasis in neurodegenerative processes have focused on cytoplasmic chaperones, there is increasing evidence that chaperones secreted both by neurons and other brain cells in the extracellular – including transsynaptic – space play important roles in neuronal proteostasis. In this review, we will introduce various secreted chaperones involved in neurodegeneration. We begin with clusterin and discuss its identification in various protein aggregates, and the use of increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clusterin as a potential biomarker and as a potential therapeutic. Our next secreted chaperone is progranulin; polymorphisms in this gene represent a known genetic risk factor for frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and progranulin overexpression has been found to be effective in reducing Alzheimer’s- and Parkinson’s-like neurodegenerative phenotypes in mouse models. We move on to BRICHOS domain-containing proteins, a family of proteins containing highly potent anti-amyloidogenic activity; we summarize studies describing the biochemical mechanisms by which recombinant BRICHOS protein might serve as a therapeutic agent. The next section of the review is devoted to the secreted chaperones 7B2 and proSAAS, small neuronal proteins which are packaged together with neuropeptides and released during synaptic activity. Since proteins can be secreted by both classical secretory and non-classical mechanisms, we also review the small heat shock proteins (sHsps) that can be secreted from the cytoplasm to the extracellular environment and provide evidence for their involvement in extracellular proteostasis and neuroprotection. Our goal in this review focusing on extracellular chaperones in neurodegenerative disease is to summarize the most recent literature relating to neurodegeneration for each secreted chaperone; to identify any common mechanisms; and to point out areas of similarity as well as differences between the secreted chaperones identified to date.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mechanisms of Pathogenic Tau and Aβ Protein Spreading in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is pathologically defined by extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides generated by the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), strings of hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins accumulating inside neurons known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuronal loss. The association between the two hallmarks and cognitive decline has been known since the beginning of the 20th century when the first description of the disease was carried out by Alois Alzheimer. Today, more than 40 million people worldwide are affected by AD that represents the most common cause of dementia and there is still no effective treatment available to cure the disease. In general, the aggregation of Aβ is considered an essential trigger in AD pathogenesis that gives rise to NFTs, neuronal dysfunction and dementia. During the process leading to AD, tau and Aβ first misfold and form aggregates in one brain region, from where they spread to interconnected areas of the brain thereby inducing its gradual morphological and functional deterioration. In this mini-review article, we present an overview of the current literature on the spreading mechanisms of Aβ and tau pathology in AD since a more profound understanding is necessary to design therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing or halting disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Human brain development is influenced by early-life experiences, particularly during sensitive periods, with impact on cognitive and emotional outcomes. Understanding how the timing and nature of such experiences (including adversity, trauma, and enrichment) govern their influence on brain organization is crucial for harnessing key environmental factors early in life to enhance brain development. Here we synthesize findings from human and animal studies focusing on sensitive periods and their regional and circuit specificity and highlight the challenge and power of such cross-species approaches in informing the ‘next steps’ to optimize cognitive and emotional health in developing children.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A steady-state model of microbial acclimation to substrate limitation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by John R. Casey, Michael J. Follows&lt;/p&gt;

Microbes acclimate to changes in substrate availability by altering the number of transporters on the cell surface, however there is some disagreement on just how. We revisit the physics of substrate uptake and consider the steady-state scenario whereby cells have acclimated to maximize fitness. Flux balance analysis of a stoichiometric model of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was used in conjunction with quantitative proteomics data and molecular modeling of membrane transporters to reconcile these opposing views. An emergent feature of the proposed model is a critical substrate concentration &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;*, which delineates two rate limits. At concentrations above &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;*, transporter abundance can be regulated to maintain uptake rates as demanded by maximal growth rates, whereas below &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;*, uptake rates are strictly diffusion limited. In certain scenarios, the proposed model can take on a qualitatively different shape from the familiar hyperbolic kinetics curves, instead resembling the long-forgotten Blackman kinetics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bm1t2IRj0pU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Cortical tracking of speech in noise accounts for reading strategies in children</title>

Humans’ propensity to acquire literacy relates to several factors, including the ability to understand speech in noise (SiN). Still, the nature of the relation between reading and SiN perception abilities remains poorly understood. Here, we dissect the interplay between (1) reading abilities, (2) classical behavioral predictors of reading (phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid automatized naming), and (3) electrophysiological markers of SiN perception in 99 elementary school children (26 with dyslexia). We demonstrate that, in typical readers, cortical representation of the phrasal content of SiN relates to the degree of development of the lexical (but not sublexical) reading strategy. In contrast, classical behavioral predictors of reading abilities and the ability to benefit from visual speech to represent the syllabic content of SiN account for global reading performance (i.e., speed and accuracy of lexical and sublexical reading). In individuals with dyslexia, we found preserved integration of visual speech information to optimize processing of syntactic information but not to sustain acoustic/phonemic processing. Finally, within children with dyslexia, measures of cortical representation of the phrasal content of SiN were negatively related to reading speed and positively related to the compromise between reading precision and reading speed, potentially owing to compensatory attentional mechanisms. These results clarify the nature of the relation between SiN perception and reading abilities in typical child readers and children with dyslexia and identify novel electrophysiological markers of emergent literacy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GrlGEmn0lpk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Thyroid Hormone and Neural Stem Cells: Repair Potential Following Brain and Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00875</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by chronic neuronal and/or glial cell loss, while traumatic injury is often accompanied by the acute loss of both. Multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mammalian brain spontaneously proliferate, forming neuronal and glial progenitors that migrate toward lesion sites upon injury. However, they fail to replace neurons and glial cells due to molecular inhibition and the lack of pro-regenerative cues. A major challenge in regenerative biology therefore is to unveil signaling pathways that could override molecular brakes and boost endogenous repair. In physiological conditions, thyroid hormone (TH) acts on NSC commitment in the subventricular zone, and the subgranular zone, the two largest NSC niches in mammals, including humans. Here, we discuss whether TH could have beneficial actions in various pathological contexts too, by evaluating recent data obtained in mammalian models of multiple sclerosis (MS; loss of oligodendroglial cells), Alzheimer’s disease (loss of neuronal cells), stroke and spinal cord injury (neuroglial cell loss). So far, TH has shown promising effects as a stimulator of remyelination in MS models, while its role in NSC-mediated repair in other diseases remains elusive. Disentangling the spatiotemporal aspects of the injury-driven repair response as well as the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which TH acts, could unveil new ways to further exploit its pro-regenerative potential, while TH (ant)agonists with cell type-specific action could provide safer and more target-directed approaches that translate easier to clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Oxidative Stress Marker Aberrations in Multiple Sclerosis: A Meta-Analysis Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress has been suggested to play a key role in multiple sclerosis (MS), but clinical data on oxidative stress markers in MS patients were inconsistent. This study sought to quantitatively summarize the data of oxidative stress markers in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MS in the literature. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science and included studies if they provided data on the concentrations of oxidative stress markers in the peripheral blood and CSF of MS patients and healthy control (HC) subjects. The systematic search resulted in the inclusion of 31 studies with 2,001 MS patients and 2,212 HC subjects for meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with MS had significantly increased concentrations of blood oxidative stress markers compared with HC subjects for malondialdehyde (MDA; Hedges' g, 2.252; 95% CI, 1.080 to 3.424; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and lipid hydroperoxide by tert-butyl hydroperoxide-initiated chemiluminescence (CL-LOOH; Hedges' g, 0.383; 95% CI, 0.065 to 0.702; p = 0.018). In contrast, concentrations of albumin (Hedges' g, −1.036; CI, −1.679 to −0.394; p = 0.002) were significantly decreased in MS patients when compared with those in HC subjects. However, the other analyzed blood oxidative stress markers did not show significant differences between cases and controls. Furthermore, this meta-analysis showed significant association between CSF MDA and MS (Hedges' g, 3.275; 95% CI, 0.859 to 5.691; p = 0.008). Taken together, our results revealed increased blood and CSF MDA and decreased blood albumin levels in patients with MS, strengthening the clinical evidence of increased oxidative stress in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Disrupted Rich Club Organization of Hemispheric White Matter Networks in Bipolar Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00039</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies suggest disrupted connections of the brain white matter (WM) network in bipolar disorder (BD). A group of highly interconnected high-density structures, termed the ‘rich club,’ represents an important network for brain functioning. Recent works have revealed abnormal rich club organization in brain networks in BD. However, little is known regarding changes in the rich club organization of the hemispheric WM network in BD. Forty-nine BD patients and fifty-five age- and sex-matched normal controls (NCs) underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Graph theory approaches were applied to quantify group-specific rich club organization and nodal degree of hemispheric WM networks. We demonstrated that rich club organization of hemispheric WM networks in BD was disrupted, with disrupted feeder and local connections among hub and peripheral regions located in the default mode network (DMN) and the control execution network (CEN). In addition, BD patients showed abnormal asymmetry in the feeder and local connections, involving the hub and peripheral regions associated with emotion regulation and visuospatial functions. Moreover, the clinical symptoms of BD showed a significant correlation with the aberrant asymmetry in the regional degree of peripheral regions. These findings reveal that BD is closely associated with disrupted feeder and local connections but no alteration in rich-club connections in the rich club organization of hemispheric WM networks and provide novel insight into the changes of brain functions in BD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Subthreshold Electrical Noise Applied to the Plantar Foot Enhances Lower-Limb Cutaneous Reflex Generation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00351</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00351</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reflex responses generated by cutaneous mechanoreceptors of the plantar foot are important for the maintenance of balance during postural tasks and gait. With aging, reflex generation, particularly from fast adapting type I receptors, is reduced, which likely contributes to impaired postural stability in this population. Therefore, improving reflex generation from these receptors may serve as a tool to improve balance performance. A mechanism to enhance reflexes may lie in the phenomenon of stochastic resonance, whereby the addition of certain intensities and frequencies of noise stimuli improves the performance of a system. This study was conducted to determine whether tactile noise stimuli could improve cutaneous reflex generation. In 12 healthy young adults, we evoked cutaneous reflex responses using a 0–50 Hz Gaussian noise vibration applied to the plantar heel. Concurrently, we applied one of six subthreshold intensities of electrical tactile noise to the plantar heel [0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% or 100% (threshold)] and were able to analyze data from 0%, 20% and 40% trials. Across participants, it was found that the addition of a 20% perceptual threshold (PT) noise resulted in enhanced reflex responses when analyzed in both the time and frequency domains. These data provide evidence that cutaneous reflex generation can be enhanced via a stochastic resonance effect and that 20% PT is the optimal intensity of noise to do so. Therefore, the addition of noise stimuli may be a valuable clinical intervention to improve reflex responses associated with postural balance in populations with impairments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Links Between the Neurobiology of Oxytocin and Human Musicality</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00350</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human species possesses two complementary, yet distinct, universal communication systems—language and music. Functional imaging studies have revealed that some core elements of these two systems are processed in closely related brain regions, but there are also clear differences in brain circuitry that likely underlie differences in functionality. Music affects many aspects of human behavior, especially in encouraging prosocial interactions and promoting trust and cooperation within groups of culturally compatible but not necessarily genetically related individuals. Music, presumably via its impact on the limbic system, is also rewarding and motivating, and music can facilitate aspects of learning and memory. In this review these special characteristics of music are considered in light of recent research on the neuroscience of the peptide oxytocin, a hormone that has both peripheral and central actions, that plays a role in many complex human behaviors, and whose expression has recently been reported to be affected by music-related activities. I will first briefly discuss what is currently known about the peptide’s physiological actions on neurons and its interactions with other neuromodulator systems, then summarize recent advances in our knowledge of the distribution of oxytocin and its receptor (OXTR) in the human brain. Next, the complex links between oxytocin and various social behaviors in humans are considered. First, how endogenous oxytocin levels relate to individual personality traits, and then how exogenous, intranasal application of oxytocin affects behaviors such as trust, empathy, reciprocity, group conformity, anxiety, and overall social decision making under different environmental conditions. It is argued that many of these characteristics of oxytocin biology closely mirror the diverse effects that music has on human cognition and emotion, providing a link to the important role music has played throughout human evolutionary history and helping to explain why music remains a special prosocial human asset. Finally, it is suggested that there is a potential synergy in combining oxytocin- and music-based strategies to improve general health and aid in the treatment of various neurological dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Association Between Interictal High-Frequency Oscillations and Slow Wave in Refractory Focal Epilepsy With Good Surgical Outcome</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been proposed as a promising biomarker of the epileptogenic zone (EZ). But accurate delineation of EZ based on HFOs is still challenging. Our study compared HFOs from EZ and non-EZ on the basis of their associations with interictal slow waves, aiming at exploring a new way to localize EZ. Nineteen medically intractable epilepsy patients with good surgical outcome were included. Five minute interictal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) epochs of slow-wave sleep were randomly selected; then ripples (80–200 Hz), fast ripples (FRs; 200–500 Hz), and slow waves (0.1–4 Hz) were automatically analyzed. The EZ and non-EZ were identified by resection range during the surgeries. We found that both ripples and FRs superimposed more frequently on slow waves in EZ than in non-EZ (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Although ripples preferred to occur on the down state of slow waves in both two groups, ripples in EZ tended to be closer to the down-state peak of slow wave than in non-EZ (-174 vs. -231 ms, P = 0.008). As for FR, no statistical difference was found between the two groups (P = 0.430). Additionally, slow wave-containing ripples in EZ had a steeper slope (1.7 vs. 1.5 μV/ms, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and wider distribution ratio (32.3 vs. 30.1%, P &amp;lt; 0.001) than those in the non-EZ. But for slow wave-containing FR, only a steeper slope (1.7 vs. 1.4 μV/ms, P &amp;lt; 0.001) was observed. Our study innovatively compared the different features of association between HFOs and slow wave in EZ and non-EZ from refractory focal epilepsy with good surgical outcome, proposing a new method to localize EZ and facilitating the surgical plan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Why Brain Criticality Is Clinically Relevant: A Scoping Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00054</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00054</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The past 25 years have seen a strong increase in the number of publications related to criticality in different areas of neuroscience. The potential of criticality to explain various brain properties, including optimal information processing, has made it an increasingly exciting area of investigation for neuroscientists. Recent reviews on this topic, sometimes termed brain criticality, make brief mention of clinical applications of these findings to several neurological disorders such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative disease, and neonatal hypoxia. Other clinicallyrelevant domains – including anesthesia, sleep medicine, developmental-behavioral pediatrics, and psychiatry – are seldom discussed in review papers of brain criticality. Thorough assessments of these application areas and their relevance for clinicians have also yet to be published. In this scoping review, studies of brain criticality involving human data of all ages are evaluated for their current and future clinical relevance. To make the results of these studies understandable to a more clinical audience, a review of the key concepts behind criticality (e.g., phase transitions, long-range temporal correlation, self-organized criticality, power laws, branching processes) precedes the discussion of human clinical studies. Open questions and forthcoming areas of investigation are also considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Kainate Receptor Subunit GluK2 Interacts With KCC2 to Promote Maturation of Dendritic Spines</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00252</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00252</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Kainate receptors (KAR) play a crucial role in the plasticity and functional maturation of glutamatergic synapses. However, how they regulate structural plasticity of dendritic spines is not known. The GluK2 subunit was recently shown to coexist in a functional complex with the neuronal K-Cl cotransporter KCC2. Apart from having a crucial role in the maturation of GABAergic transmission, KCC2 has a morphogenic role in the maturation of dendritic spines. Here, we show that in vivo local inactivation of GluK2 expression in CA3 hippocampal neurons induces altered morphology of dendritic spines and reduction in mEPSC frequency. GluK2 deficiency also resulted in a strong change in the subcellular distribution of KCC2 as well as a smaller somatodendritic gradient in the reversal potential of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Strikingly, the aberrant morphology of dendritic spines in GluK2-deficient CA3 pyramidal neurons was restored by overexpression of KCC2. GluK2 silencing in hippocampal neurons significantly reduced the expression of 4.1N and functional form of the actin filament severing protein cofilin. Consistently, assessment of actin dynamics using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of β-actin showed a significant increase in the stability of F-actin filaments in dendritic spines. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that GluK2-KCC2 interaction plays an important role in the structural maturation of dendritic spines. This also provides novel insights into the connection between KAR dysfunction, structural plasticity, and developmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Regional Network Covariance of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Gray Matter in the Rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00267</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Healthy human aging has been associated with brain atrophy in prefrontal and selective temporal regions, but reductions in other brain areas have been observed. We previously found regional covariance patterns of gray matter with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy humans and rhesus macaques, using multivariate network Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM) analysis and voxel-based morphometry (VBM), supporting aging effects including in prefrontal and temporal cortices. This approach has yet to be applied to neuroimaging in rodent models of aging. We investigated 7.0T MRI gray matter covariance in 10 young and 10 aged adult male Fischer 344 rats to identify, using SSM VBM, the age-related regional network gray matter covariance pattern in the rodent. SSM VBM identified a regional pattern that distinguished young from aged rats, characterized by reductions in prefrontal, temporal association/perirhinal, and cerebellar areas with relative increases in somatosensory, thalamic, midbrain, and hippocampal regions. Greater expression of the age-related MRI gray matter pattern was associated with poorer spatial learning in the age groups combined. Aging in the rat is characterized by a regional network pattern of gray matter reductions corresponding to aging effects previously observed in humans and non-human primates. SSM MRI network analyses can advance translational aging neuroscience research, extending from human to small animal models, with potential for evaluating mechanisms and interventions for cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Predictive Value of Odor Identification for Incident Dementia: The Shanghai Aging Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00266</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00266</link>
	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to evaluate the value of odors in the olfactory identification (OI) test and other known risk factors for predicting incident dementia in the prospective Shanghai Aging Study.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;At baseline, OI was assessed using the Sniffin’ Sticks Screening Test 12, which contains 12 different odors. Cognition assessment and consensus diagnosis were conducted at both baseline and follow-up to identify incident dementia. Four different multivariable logistic regression (MLR) models were used for predicting incident dementia. In the no-odor model, only demographics, lifestyle, and medical history variables were included. In the single-odor model, we further added one single odor to the first model. In the full model, all 12 odors were included. In the stepwise model, the variables were selected using a bidirectional stepwise selection method. The predictive abilities of these models were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The permutation importance method was used to evaluate the relative importance of different odors and other known risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Seventy-five (8%) incident dementia cases were diagnosed during 4.9 years of follow-up among 947 participants. The full and the stepwise MLR model (AUC = 0.916 and 0.914, respectively) have better predictive abilities compared with those of the no- or single-odor models. The five most important variables are Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, age, peppermint detection, coronary artery disease, and height in the full model, and MMSE, age, peppermint detection, stroke, and education in the stepwise model. The combination of only the top five variables in the stepwise model (AUC = 0.901 and sensitivity = 0.880) has as a good a predictive ability as other models.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The ability to smell peppermint might be one of the useful indicators for predicting dementia. Combining peppermint detection with MMSE, age, education, and history of stroke may have sensitive and robust predictive value for dementia in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Factors Associated With the Occurrence and Evolution of Recent Small Subcortical Infarcts (RSSIs) in Different Locations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00264</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00264</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent small subcortical infarcts (RSSIs) can occur in different brain regions. Distinct etiologies might be involved for RSSIs in different locations and could further affect RSSI cavitation and functional outcomes. In this study, we aim to analyze the baseline clinical and imaging characteristics associated with the occurrence and cavitation of RSSIs in different locations. We retrospectively include patients who presented with RSSIs from a database for cerebral small vessel disease. Detailed information, including demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data, were collected. We identify baseline RSSIs on diffusion-weighted images and divide them into brainstem, subcortical white matter, and basal ganglia region groups. Cavitation is evaluated on follow-up T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Statistical analysis is performed to determine factors associated with the occurrence and cavitation of RSSIs in different locations. We find that patients with brainstem RSSIs have a higher proportion of diabetes (64.1%) compared to patients with subcortical white matter (27.3%, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and basal ganglia region RSSIs (35.2%, P = 0.006) and have higher levels of HbA1c (7.20%) compared to patients with subcortical white matter (6.10%, P = 0.001) and basal ganglia region RSSIs (6.20%, P = 0.003). In addition, patients with brainstem RSSIs have higher NIHSS scores than patients with subcortical white matter RSSIs (2 vs 0, P = 0.001). Patients with subcortical white matter RSSIs have higher a white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden compared to patients with basal ganglia region RSSIs (21.64 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; vs 11.10 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, P = 0.004). Follow-up analysis demonstrates that basal ganglia region RSSIs are less likely to cavitate than subcortical white matter RSSIs (61.4% vs 83.6%, P = 0.010), and contacting with WMH is associated with the cavitation of subcortical white matter RSSIs (OR: 101.760, P = 0.003). Our study demonstrates that RSSIs in different locations are associated with different clinical and imaging characteristics. Furthermore, cavitation of RSSIs might be affected by local lesion features and the surrounding environment rather than general demographic and clinical factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: CISD2 Attenuates Inflammation and Regulates Microglia Polarization in EOC Microglial Cells—As a Potential Therapeutic Target for Neurodegenerative Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00260</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00260</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Accumulating evidence has demonstrated a significant association between microglia-driven inflammation in the brain and neurodegenerative dementia. We previously showed a significant decline in CISD2 expression in mice models with advanced age. Moreover, we observed that the knockdown of CISD2 led to remarkable inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in neural cells. In the present study, we investigated whether CISD2 attenuation influences anti-inflammatory effects and M1-M2 polarization in microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: The knockdown of CISD2 expression by siRNA (siCISD2) in EOC microglial cells was performed to mimic the age-driven decline of CISD2 expression. The extent of the inflammatory reaction, polarization in the M1/M2 spectrum, and NFκB activation were verified in EOC microglial cells exhibiting CISD2 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In the cellular model of microglia, loss of CISD2 function mediated by siCISD2 exhibited a significant augmentation of proinflammatory signaling, as well as reduced expression levels of Arg-1, Ym1, IL-10, and BCL2. Attenuation of CISD2 expression led to a decrease in the proportion of the M2 phenotype of microglia (compared to M1). Enhanced DNA-binding activity of the NFκB p65 subunit was confirmed in cells transfected with siCISD2, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report examining the following phenomena: (1) anti-inflammatory effects of CISD2 in microglia via NFκB regulation; and (2) microglial CISD2 assistance in the restoration of M2 microglia phenotype. The anti-inflammatory effects of CISD2 in microglia eventually augment anti-apoptotic effects, which provides a rationale for the development of potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases and neurodegenerative dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Role of EEG in Measuring Cognitive Reserve: A Rapid Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00249</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00249</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This review aimed to systematically summarize the possible neural correlates of cognitive reserve thus giving an insight into prospective biomarkers for the concept. A total of 44 studies were analyzed following PRISMA guidelines and four studies were included in the further analysis. The results indicated a relationship between P3b waveform and cognitive reserve, while more ambiguous outcomes were found when conducting resting-state EEG. This review indicates the first steps into assessing CR using physiological measures; however, more research is needed for deeper understanding of its underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>How does our visual brain generate perceptual color space? Liu et al. find that within a uniform blob-like architecture of hue responses, chromotopic maps develop progressively in scale and precision along the visual hierarchy of macaque V1, V2, and V4. Such hierarchical refinement improves spectral uniformity, better reflecting color perception.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Partitioning stable and unstable expression level variation in cell populations: A theoretical framework and its application to the T cell receptor</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Thiago S. Guzella, Vasco M. Barreto, Jorge Carneiro&lt;/p&gt;

Phenotypic variation in the copy number of gene products expressed by cells or tissues has been the focus of intense investigation. To what extent the observed differences in cellular expression levels are persistent or transient is an intriguing question. Here, we develop a quantitative framework that resolves the expression variation into stable and unstable components. The difference between the expression means in two cohorts isolated from any cell population is shown to converge to an asymptotic value, with a characteristic time, &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, that measures the timescale of the unstable dynamics. The asymptotic difference in the means, relative to the initial value, measures the stable proportion of the original population variance R α 2. Empowered by this insight, we analysed the T-cell receptor (TCR) expression variation in CD4 T cells. About 70% of TCR expression variance is stable in a diverse polyclonal population, while over 80% of the variance in an isogenic TCR transgenic population is volatile. In both populations the TCR levels fluctuate with a characteristic time of 32 hours. This systematic characterisation of the expression variation dynamics, relying on time series of cohorts’ means, can be combined with technologies that measure gene or protein expression in single cells or in bulk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BAblQzdt3Fo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Firing rate homeostasis counteracts changes in stability of recurrent neural networks caused by synapse loss in Alzheimer’s disease</title>

The impairment of cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease is clearly correlated to synapse loss. However, the mechanisms underlying this correlation are only poorly understood. Here, we investigate how the loss of excitatory synapses in sparsely connected random networks of spiking excitatory and inhibitory neurons alters their dynamical characteristics. Beyond the effects on the activity statistics, we find that the loss of excitatory synapses on excitatory neurons reduces the network’s sensitivity to small perturbations. This decrease in sensitivity can be considered as an indication of a reduction of computational capacity. A full recovery of the network’s dynamical characteristics and sensitivity can be achieved by firing rate homeostasis, here implemented by an up-scaling of the remaining excitatory-excitatory synapses. Mean-field analysis reveals that the stability of the linearised network dynamics is, in good approximation, uniquely determined by the firing rate, and thereby explains why firing rate homeostasis preserves not only the firing rate but also the network’s sensitivity to small perturbations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jQqBQvPlo5c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Kavita Agarwal, Lloyd S. Robinson, Somya Aggarwal, Lynne R. Foster, Ariel Hernandez-Leyva, Hueylie Lin, Brett A. Tortelli, Valerie P. O’Brien, Liza Miller, Andrew L. Kau, Hilary Reno, Nicole M. Gilbert, Warren G. Lewis, Amanda L. Lewis&lt;/p&gt;

Women with bacterial vaginosis (BV), an imbalance of the vaginal microbiome, are more likely to be colonized by potential pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/i&gt;, a bacterium linked with intrauterine infection and preterm birth. However, the conditions and mechanisms supporting pathogen colonization during vaginal dysbiosis remain obscure. We demonstrate that sialidase activity, a diagnostic feature of BV, promoted &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; foraging and growth on mammalian sialoglycans, a nutrient resource that was otherwise inaccessible because of the lack of endogenous &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; sialidase. In mice with sialidase-producing vaginal microbiotas, mutant &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; unable to consume sialic acids was impaired in vaginal colonization. These experiments in mice also led to the discovery that &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; may also “give back” to the community by reinforcing sialidase activity, a biochemical feature of human dysbiosis. Using human vaginal bacterial communities, we show that &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; supported robust outgrowth of &lt;i&gt;Gardnerella vaginalis&lt;/i&gt;, a major sialidase producer and one of the most abundant organisms in BV. These results illustrate that mutually beneficial relationships between vaginal bacteria support pathogen colonization and may help maintain features of dysbiosis. These findings challenge the simplistic dogma that the mere absence of “healthy” lactobacilli is the sole mechanism that creates a permissive environment for pathogens during vaginal dysbiosis. Given the ubiquity of &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; in the human mouth, these studies also suggest a possible mechanism underlying links between vaginal dysbiosis and oral sex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7TBR4CibSDA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Investigation of the effect of dietary intake of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on trauma‐induced white matter injury with quantitative diffusion MRI in mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2d7aa8ec-dc06-465e-8a0d-e739f24745ec/jnr24705-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated potential neuroprotective effects of dietary omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on white matter damage following closed‐head injury in mice. While injured animals exhibited reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the optic tract and brachium compared to the uninjured animals, there was no evidence of neuroprotection from dietary omega‐3 PUFAs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that long‐term supplementation and dietary intake of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may have neuroprotective effects following brain injury. The objective of this study was to investigate potential neuroprotective effects of omega‐3 PUFAs on white matter following closed‐head trauma. The closed‐head injury model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA) produces a reproducible injury in the optic tract and brachium of the superior colliculus in mice. Damage is detectable using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, particularly fractional anisotropy (FA), with sensitivity comparable to histology. We acquired &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 38) and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 41) DTI data in mice divided into sham and CHIMERA groups with two dietary groups: one deficient in omega‐3 PUFAs and one adequate in omega‐3 PUFAs. We examined injury effects (reduction in FA) and neuroprotection (FA reduction modulated by diet) in the optic tract and brachium. We verified that diet did not affect FA in sham animals. In injured animals, we found significantly reduced FA in the optic tract and brachium (~10% reduction, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and Bayes factor analysis showed strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. However, Bayes factor analysis showed substantial evidence to accept the null hypothesis of no diet‐related FA differences in injured animals in the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; samples. Our results indicate no neuroprotective effect from adequate dietary omega‐3 PUFA intake on white matter damage following traumatic brain injury. Since damage from CHIMERA mainly affects white matter, our results do not necessarily contradict previous findings showing omega‐3 PUFA‐mediated neuroprotection in gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long‐term exposure to lipid‐lowering drugs might affect Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk. We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses where genetic variants indexed expected effects of modulating lipid‐lowering drug targets on PD. Statin exposure was not predicted to increase PD risk, although results were not precise enough to support benefits for prevention clearly (odds ratio: 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.65, 1.07). Other target results were null, except for variants indicating Apolipoprotein‐A5 or Apolipoprotein‐C3 inhibition might confer protection. These findings suggest peripheral lipid variation may not have a prominent role in PD etiology, but some related drug targets could influence PD via alternate pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neurochemical phenotype of growth hormone‐responsive cells in the mouse paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neurochemical phenotype of growth hormone‐responsive cells in the mouse paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ed9ca66c-0b1b-48f9-8f3d-c1ed766bef6c/cne25017-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the capacity of a systemic growth hormone (GH) injection to induce STAT5 phosphorylation in the mouse brain, we identified several neurochemically distinct neuronal populations in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus that are directly responsive to GH, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‐, somatostatin (SST)‐, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH)‐ and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH)‐producing neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses are regulated by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). Previous studies have shown that PVH neurons express the growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR), although the role of GH signaling on PVH neurons is still unknown. Given the great heterogeneity of cell types located in the PVH, we performed a detailed analysis of the neurochemical identity of GH‐responsive cells to understand the possible physiological importance of GH action on PVH neurons. GH‐responsive cells were detected via the phosphorylated form of the signal transducer and activator of transcription‐5 (pSTAT5) in adult male mice that received an intraperitoneal GH injection. Approximately 51% of GH‐responsive cells in the PVH co‐localized with the vesicular glutamate transporter 2. Rare co‐localizations between pSTAT5 and vesicular GABA transporter or vasopressin were observed, whereas approximately 20% and 38% of oxytocin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) cells, respectively, were responsive to GH in the PVH. Approximately 55%, 35% and 63% of somatostatin, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH) neurons expressed GH‐induced pSTAT5, respectively. Additionally, 8%, 49% and 75% of neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons, and 67%, 32% and 74% of non‐neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons were responsive to GH in the PVH of Fluoro‐Gold‐injected mice. Our findings suggest that GH action on PVH neurons is involved in the regulation of the thyroid, somatotropic and adrenal endocrine axes, possibly influencing homeostatic and stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neural anatomy of echinoid early juveniles and comparison of nervous system organization in echinoderms</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neural anatomy of echinoid early juveniles and comparison of nervous system organization in echinoderms&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1ab9ab09-4f90-4a8c-96d5-ef7053f05a54/cne25012-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used on juveniles of three echinoderm species to characterize their neuroanatomy. Detailed comparisons confirmed the conservation, among the three species, of a tripartite neuroanatomical organization and revealed similar innervation patterns at the level of the appendages (i.e. the podia and the spines).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The echinoderms are a phylum of marine deuterostomes characterized by the pentaradial (five fold) symmetry of their adult bodies. Due to this unusual body plan, adult echinoderms have long been excluded from comparative analyses aimed at understanding the origin and evolution of deuterostome nervous systems. Here, we investigated the neural anatomy of early juveniles of members of three of the five echinoderm classes: the echinoid &lt;i&gt;Paracentrotus lividus&lt;/i&gt;, the asteroid &lt;i&gt;Patiria miniata&lt;/i&gt;, and the holothuroid &lt;i&gt;Parastichopus parvimensis&lt;/i&gt;. Using whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that the nervous system of echinoid early juveniles is composed of three main structures: a basiepidermal nerve plexus, five radial nerve cords connected by a circumoral nerve ring, and peripheral nerves innervating the appendages. Our whole mount preparations further allowed us to obtain thorough descriptions of these structures and of several innervation patterns, in particular at the level of the appendages. Detailed comparisons of the echinoid juvenile nervous system with those of asteroid and holothuroid juveniles moreover supported a general conservation of the main neural structures in all three species. Our results sustain the hypotheses of previous work for the existence of two neural units in echinoderms: one consisting of the basiepidermal nerve plexus to process sensory stimuli locally, and one composed of the radial nerve cords and the peripheral nerves constituting a centralized control system. This study provides the basis of more in‐depth comparisons of the echinoderm adult nervous system with those of other animals, in particular hemichordates and chordates, to address the long‐standing controversies about deuterostome nervous system evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Photoreceptors in skate are arranged to allow for a broad horizontal field of view&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e406493f-64fd-4138-92a3-a1e51ca76856/cne25014-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoreceptor morphology and anatomy, including their density distribution and orientation were studied in the skate &lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea&lt;/i&gt;. In addition to a dorsal visual streak, which is typical in elasmobranchs, photoreceptors were noticeably tilted, a finding that has to date not received much attention. Skate &lt;i&gt;L. erinacea&lt;/i&gt; (left), and image of a whole‐mounted retina showing retinal photoreceptors (right).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying retinal specializations offers insights into eye functionality and visual ecology. Using light microscopic techniques, including retinal whole‐mounts, we investigated photoreceptor densities in the retina of the skate &lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea.&lt;/i&gt; We show that photoreceptors are not sized or oriented in the same way, and that they are not evenly distributed across the retina. There was a dorsally located horizontal visual streak with increased photoreceptor density, with additional local maxima in which densities were highest. Photoreceptors were longest and thinnest inside this visual streak, becoming shorter and thicker toward the periphery and toward the ventral retina. Furthermore, in the peripheral retinal parts, photoreceptors (particularly the outer segments) were noticeably tilted with respect to the retinal long axis. In order to understand how photoreceptors are tilted inside the eye, we used computerized tomography (CT) and micro‐CT, to obtain geometrical dimensions of the whole skate eye. These CT/micro‐CT data provided us with the outlines of the skate eye and the location of the retina and this enabled us to reconstruct how photoreceptors tilt in an intact eye. Findings were analyzed relative to previously published ganglion cell distributions in this species, showing a posteriorly located retinal area with photoreceptor:ganglion cell convergence as low as 39:1. Some peripheral areas showed ratios as high as 391:1. We frame our findings in terms of the animal’s anatomy: body and eye shape, specifically the location of the tapetum, as well as the visual demands associated with lifestyle and habitat type. A speculative function in polarization sensitivity is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: A natural endocast of an early Miocene odontocete and its implications in cetacean brain evolution</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;A natural endocast of an early Miocene odontocete and its implications in cetacean brain evolution&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b4bc0cf-6228-403c-88fe-e30c82ac858e/cne25015-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 19‐to‐16 million year old natural endocast of an odontocete whale is described and compared. The exceptional preservation allowed the identification of major neural and vascular characters opening a window into the cetacean brain evolution. The encephalization quotient and other statistical analyses revealed that this endocast belonged to a scarcely encephalized, early‐diverging toothed whale and helped in interpreting a number of morphological changes in odontocete brain evolution.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural endocast MGPT‐PU 13873 is described and analyzed in order to interpret its taxonomic affinities and its potential significance on our understanding of cetacean brain evolution. The endocast is from the early Miocene of Piedmont (between &lt;i&gt;c.&lt;/i&gt; 19 and 16 million years ago), Northwestern Italy, and shows a number of plesiomorphic characters. These include: scarcely rounded cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum exposed in dorsal view with little superimposition by the cerebral hemispheres, short temporal lobe and long sylvian fissure. The distance between the hypophysis and the rostral pons is particularly high, as it was determined by the calculus of the hypothalamus quotient, suggesting that the development of a deep interpeduncular fossa was not as advanced as in living odontocetes. The encephalization quotient of MGPT‐PU 13873 is &lt;i&gt;c.&lt;/i&gt; 1.81, therefore this specimen shows an encephalization quotient in line with other fossil whales of the same geological age (early Miocene). Comparative analysis shows that there is a critical lack of data from the late Miocene and Pliocene that prevents us to fully understand the recent evolution of the EQ diversity in whales. Moreover, the past diversity of brain size and shape in mysticetes is virtually unknown. All these observations point to the need of additional efforts to uncover evolutionary patterns and processes on cetacean brain evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
