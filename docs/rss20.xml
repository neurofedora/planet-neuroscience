	<description>In 2006, Ma et al. (Nat. Neurosci. 1006;9:1432–1438) presented an elegant theory for how populations of neurons might represent uncertainty to perform Bayesian inference. Critically, according to this theory, neural variability is no longer a nuisance, but rather a vital part of how the brain encodes probability distributions and performs computations with them.</description>

	<description>Large-scale efforts are underway to map the neuronal connectomes of various animal species. In 1986 White et al. reported the first complete reconstruction of the nervous system connectome of an animal. Largely through manual reconstruction of serial electron micrographs, the authors characterized the morphology of each of the 302 neurons of the adult nematode C. elegans, and mapped the chemical and electrical synapses that connect them. This wiring diagram has profoundly influenced behavioral neurobiology and network science, and it continues to offer a guide for the impact of connectomics on neurobiology.</description>

	<description>In a 2016 paper, Huth and colleagues probed, in a general way, how word meanings map onto cortical locations. By comparing the fit between alternative maps, this methodology offered a means to evaluate what sorts of meaning representations the brain handles under ecologically realistic conditions.</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Dynamic constraints on activity and connectivity during the learning of value. (arXiv:1810.08840v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08840</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human learning is a complex process in which future behavior is altered via
the modulation of neural activity. Yet, the degree to which brain activity and
functional connectivity during learning is constrained across subjects, for
example by conserved anatomy and physiology or by the nature of the task,
remains unknown. Here, we measured brain activity and functional connectivity
in a longitudinal experiment in which healthy adult human participants learned
the values of novel objects over the course of four days. We assessed the
presence of constraints on activity and functional connectivity using an
inter-subject correlation approach. Constraints on activity and connectivity
were greater in magnitude than expected in a non-parametric permutation-based
null model, particularly in primary sensory and motor systems, as well as in
regions associated with the learning of value. Notably, inter-subject
connectivity in activity and connectivity displayed marked temporal variations,
with inter-subject correlations in activity exceeding those in connectivity
during early learning and \emph{visa versa} in later learning. Finally,
individual differences in performance accuracy tracked the degree to which a
subject's connectivity, but not activity, tracked subject-general patterns.
Taken together, our results support the notion that brain activity and
connectivity are constrained across subjects in early learning, with
constraints on activity, but not connectivity, decreasing in later learning.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We developed a model of cortical computation that implements key features of
cortical circuitry and is capable of describing propagation of neural signals
between cortical locations in response to spatially distributed stimuli. The
model is based on the canonical neural circuit that consists of excitatory and
inhibitory cells interacting through reciprocal connections, with recurrent
feedback. The canonical circuit is used as a node in a distributed network with
nearest neighbor coupling between the nodes. We find that this system is
characterized by intrinsic preference for spatial frequency. The value of
preferred frequency depends on the relative weights of excitatory and
inhibitory connections between cells. This balance of excitation and inhibition
changes as stimulus contrast increases, which is why intrinsic spatial
frequency is predicted to change with contrast in a manner determined by
stimulus temporal frequency. The dynamics of network preference is consistent
with properties of the cortical area MT in alert macaque monkeys.

	<description>Cellular actin assembly is controlled at the barbed ends of actin filaments, where capping protein (CP) limits polymerization. Twinfilin is a conserved in vivo binding partner of CP, yet the significance of this interaction has remained a mystery. Here, we discover that the C-terminal tail of Twinfilin harbors a CP-interacting (CPI) motif, identifying it as a novel CPI-motif protein. Twinfilin and the CPI-motif protein CARMIL have overlapping binding sites on CP. Further, Twinfilin binds competitively with CARMIL to CP, protecting CP from barbed-end displacement by CARMIL. Twinfilin also accelerates dissociation of the CP inhibitor V-1, restoring CP to an active capping state. Knockdowns of Twinfilin and CP each cause similar defects in cell morphology, and elevated Twinfilin expression rescues defects caused by CARMIL hyperactivity. Together, these observations define Twinfilin as the first 'pro-capping' ligand of CP and lead us to propose important revisions to our understanding of the CP regulatory cycle.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Analogue closed-loop optogenetic modulation of hippocampal pyramidal cells dissociates gamma frequency and amplitude</title>

	<description>Gamma-band oscillations are implicated in modulation of attention, integration of sensory information and flexible communication among anatomically connected brain areas. How networks become entrained is incompletely understood. Specifically, it is unclear how the spectral and temporal characteristics of network oscillations can be altered on rapid timescales needed for efficient communication. We use closed-loop optogenetic modulation of principal cell excitability in mouse hippocampal slices to interrogate the dynamical properties of hippocampal oscillations. Gamma frequency and amplitude can be modulated bi-directionally, and dissociated, by phase-advancing or delaying optogenetic feedback to pyramidal cells. Closed-loop modulation alters the synchrony rather than average frequency of action potentials, in principle avoiding disruption of population rate-coding of information. Modulation of phasic excitatory currents in principal neurons is sufficient to manipulate oscillations, suggesting that feed-forward excitation of pyramidal cells has an important role in determining oscillatory dynamics and the ability of networks to couple with one another.</description>

	<description>Cardiorespiratory recovery from apneas requires dynamic responses of brainstem circuitry. One implicated component is the raphe system of &lt;i&gt;Pet1&lt;/i&gt;-expressing (largely serotonergic) neurons, however their precise requirement neonatally for homeostasis is unclear, yet central toward understanding newborn cardiorespiratory control and dysfunction. Here we show that acute in vivo perturbation of &lt;i&gt;Pet1-&lt;/i&gt;neuron activity, via triggering cell-autonomously the synthetic inhibitory receptor hM4D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, resulted in altered baseline cardiorespiratory properties and diminished apnea survival. Respiratory more than heart rate recovery was impaired, uncoupling their normal linear relationship. Disordered gasp recovery from the initial apnea distinguished mice that would go on to die during subsequent apneas. Further, the risk likelihood of apnea-related mortality associated with suppression of &lt;i&gt;Pet1&lt;/i&gt; neurons was higher for animals with baseline elevated ventilatory equivalents for oxygen. These findings establish that &lt;i&gt;Pet1&lt;/i&gt; neurons play an active role in neonatal cardiorespiratory homeostasis and provide mechanistic plausibility for the serotonergic abnormalities associated with SIDS.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Pre- and postsynaptically expressed spiking-timing-dependent plasticity contribute differentially to neuronal learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/450825v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>A plethora of experimental studies have shown that long-term plasticity can be expressed pre- or postsynaptically depending on a range of factors such as developmental stage, synapse type, and activity patterns. The functional consequences of this diversity are unknown. However, in models of neuronal learning, long-term synaptic plasticity is implemented as changes in connective weights. Whereas postsynaptic expression of plasticity predominantly affects synaptic response amplitude, presynaptic expression alters both synaptic response amplitude and short-term dynamics. In other words, the consideration of long-term plasticity as a fixed change in amplitude corresponds more closely to post- than to presynaptic expression, which means theoretical outcomes based on this choice of implementation may have a postsynaptic bias. To explore the functional implications of the diversity of expression of long-term synaptic plasticity, we modelled spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) such that it was expressed either pre- or postsynaptically, or both. We tested pair-based standard STDP models and a biologically tuned triplet STDP model, and investigated the outcome in a feed-forward setting, with two different learning schemes: either inputs were triggered at different latencies, or a subset of inputs were temporally correlated. Across different STDP models and learning paradigms, we found that presynaptic changes adjusted the speed of learning, while postsynaptic expression was better at regulating spike timing and frequency. When combining both expression loci, postsynaptic changes amplified the response range, while presynaptic plasticity maintained control over postsynaptic firing rates, potentially providing a form of activity homeostasis. Our findings highlight how the seemingly innocuous choice of implementing synaptic plasticity by direct weight modification may unwittingly introduce a postsynaptic bias in modelling outcomes. We conclude that pre- and postsynaptically expressed plasticity are not interchangeable, but enable complimentary functions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The amplitude in periodic neural state trajectories underlies the tempo of rhythmic tapping</title>

	<description>Our motor commands can be exquisitely timed according to the demands of the environment, and the ability to generate rhythms of different tempos is a hallmark of musical cognition. Yet, the neuronal underpinnings behind rhythmic tapping remains elusive. Here we found that the activity of hundreds of primate medial premotor cortices (MPC) neurons show a strong periodic pattern that becomes evident when their responses are projected into a lower dimensional state space. We show that different tapping tempos are encoded by circular trajectories that travelled at a constant speed but with different radii, and that this neuronal code is highly resilient to the number of participating neurons. Crucially, the changes in the amplitude of the oscillatory dynamics in neuronal state space are a signature of beat-based timing, regardless of whether it is guided by an external metronome or is internally controlled and is not the result of repetitive motor commands. This dynamic state signal predicted the duration of the rhythmically produced intervals on a trial-by-trial basis. Furthermore, the increase in amplitude and variability of the neural trajectories accounted for the scalar property, a hallmark feature of temporal processing across tasks and species. Finally, we found that the interval-dependent increments in the radius of periodic neural trajectories are the result of larger number of neurons engaged in the production of longer intervals. Our results support the notion that beat-based timing during rhythmic behaviors is encoded in the radial curvature of periodic MPC neural population trajectories.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Subthalamic nucleus mediates the modulation on cocaine self-administration induced by ultrasonic vocalizations playback in rats</title>

	<description>Drug intake is known to be under the influence of social context. We have recently shown that presence of a peer influences drug intake in both rats and humans. Whether or not social acoustic communications between the peers play a role during cocaine or sucrose self-administration (SA) was investigated here, using playback of ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) at 50- and 22-kHz, conveying respectively positive and negative internal affective states in adult rats. To assess the neurobiological substrate of a potential USV influence on drug and food intake, we tested the effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) lesions, given its role in emotional and motivational processes. In sham-control rats, playback of USV associated with positive affective states induced long-term decreased cocaine consumption, while USV associated with negative affective states induced short-term increase. Interestingly, no effect of USV playback was observed on sucrose intake, whatever the frequency. STN lesions abolished the influence of USV on cocaine intake, highlighting the influence of STN in emotional processes induced by USV emitted by a peer. These results show how acoustic social communication is important to regulate drug intake in rats and how STN modulation could interfere with addiction processes.</description>

	<description>The neural correlates of specific brain functions such as visual orientation tuning and individual finger movements can be revealed using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data. Neurofeedback based on these distributed patterns of brain activity presents a unique ability for precise neuromodulation. Recent applications of this technique, known as decoded neurofeedback, have manipulated fear conditioning, visual perception, confidence judgements and facial preference. However, there has yet to be an empirical justification of the timing and data processing parameters of these experiments. Suboptimal parameter settings could impact the efficacy of neurofeedback learning and contribute to the 'non-responder' effect. The goal of this study was to investigate how design parameters of decoded neurofeedback experiments affect decoding accuracy and neurofeedback performance. Subjects participated in three fMRI sessions: two 'finger localizer' sessions to identify the fMRI patterns associated with each of the four fingers of the right hand, and one 'finger finding' neurofeedback session to assess neurofeedback performance. Using only the localizer data, we show that real-time decoding can be degraded by poor experiment timing or ROI selection. To set key parameters for the neurofeedback session, we used offline simulations of decoded neurofeedback using data from the localizer sessions to predict neurofeedback performance. We show that these predictions align with real neurofeedback performance at the group level and can also explain individual differences in neurofeedback success. Overall, this work demonstrates the usefulness of offline simulation to improve the success of real-time decoded neurofeedback experiments.</description>

	<description>Sex differences in gene expression are important contributors to normal physiology and mechanisms of disease. This is increasingly apparent in understanding and potentially treating chronic pain where molecular mechanisms driving sex differences in neuronal plasticity are giving new insight into why certain chronic pain disorders preferentially affect women versus men. Large transcriptomic resources are increasingly available and can be used to mine for sex differences and molecular insight using donor cohorts. We analyzed more than 250 human tibial nerve (hTN) transcriptomes from the GTex Consortium project to gain insight into sex-dependent gene expression in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). We discover 149 genes with sex differential expression. Many of the genes upregulated in men are associated with inflammation, and appear to be primarily expressed by glia or immune cells. In women, we find the differentially upregulated transcription factor SP4 that drives a regulatory program, and may impact sex differences in PNS physiology. Many of these 149 DE genes have some previous association with chronic pain but few of them have been explored thoroughly. Additionally, using clinical data in the GTex database, we identify a subset of differentially expressed (DE) genes in diseases associated with chronic pain, arthritis and type II diabetes. Our work identifies sexually dimorphic gene expression in the human PNS with implications for discovery of sex-specific pain mechanisms</description>

	<description>Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi), two key biogenic monoamine neurotransmitters, are involved in a wide range of physiological processes. However, their precise dynamics and regulation remain poorly characterized, in part due to limitations of available techniques for measuring these molecules in vivo. Here, we developed a family of GPCR Activation-Based NE/Epi (GRABNE) sensors with a 230% peak {Delta}F/F0 response to NE, good photostability, nanomolar-to-micromolar sensitivities, sub-second rapid kinetics, high specificity to NE vs. dopamine. Viral- or transgenic-mediated expression of GRABNE sensors were able to detect electrical-stimulation evoked NE release in the locus coeruleus (LC) of mouse brain slices, looming-evoked NE release in the midbrain of live zebrafish, as well as optogenetically and behaviorally triggered NE release in the LC and hypothalamus of freely moving mice. Thus, GRABNE sensors are a robust tool for rapid and specific monitoring of in vivo NE/Epi transmission in both physiological and pathological processes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Changes in thalamocortical connectivity as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals</title>

	<description>Evidence of cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by classical &quot;visual&quot; brain structures. This feature of the blind brain makes it a pivotal model to explore the limits and mechanisms of brain plasticity. However, despite recent efforts, the structural underpinnings that could explain cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear. Using advanced neuroimaging techniques, we mapped the thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of congenitally blind individuals and sighted controls to test the hypothesis that aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity can pave the way for cross-modal plasticity. We described a direct occipital takeover by the temporal projections from the thalamus, which would carry non-visual information (e.g. auditory) to the visual cortex in congenitally blinds. In addition, the amount of thalamo-occipital connectivity correlated with the cortical thickness of primary visual cortex (V1), supporting a probably common (or related) reorganization phenomena. Our results suggest that aberrant thalamocortical connectivity as one possible mechanism of cross-modal plasticity in blinds, with potential impact on cortical thickness of V1.</description>

The development of novel therapeutics is urgently required for diseases where existing treatments are failing due to the emergence of resistance. This is particularly pertinent for parasitic infections of the tropics and sub-tropics, referred to collectively as neglected tropical diseases, where the commercial incentives to develop new drugs are weak. One such disease is schistosomiasis, a highly prevalent acute and chronic condition caused by a parasitic helminth infection, with three species of the genus &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt; infecting humans. Currently, a single 40-year old drug, praziquantel, is available to treat all infective species, but its use in mass drug administration is leading to signs of drug-resistance emerging. To meet the challenge of developing new therapeutics against this disease, we developed an innovative computational drug repurposing pipeline supported by phenotypic screening. The approach highlighted several protein kinases as interesting new biological targets for schistosomiasis as they play an essential role in many parasite’s biological processes. Focusing on this target class, we also report the first elucidation of the kinome of &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma japonicum&lt;/i&gt;, as well as updated kinomes of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;haematobium&lt;/i&gt;. In comparison with the human kinome, we explored these kinomes to identify potential targets of existing inhibitors which are unique to &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt; species, allowing us to identify novel targets and suggest approved drugs that might inhibit them. These include previously suggested schistosomicidal agents such as bosutinib, dasatinib, and imatinib as well as new inhibitors such as vandetanib, saracatinib, tideglusib, alvocidib, dinaciclib, and 22 newly identified targets such as CHK1, CDC2, WEE, PAKA, MEK1. Additionally, the primary and secondary targets in &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt; of those approved drugs are also suggested, allowing for the development of novel therapeutics against this important yet neglected disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-gKKJ-Zutu0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting how and when hidden neurons skew measured synaptic interactions</title>

A major obstacle to understanding neural coding and computation is the fact that experimental recordings typically sample only a small fraction of the neurons in a circuit. Measured neural properties are skewed by interactions between recorded neurons and the “hidden” portion of the network. To properly interpret neural data and determine how biological structure gives rise to neural circuit function, we thus need a better understanding of the relationships between measured effective neural properties and the true underlying physiological properties. Here, we focus on how the effective spatiotemporal dynamics of the synaptic interactions between neurons are reshaped by coupling to unobserved neurons. We find that the effective interactions from a pre-synaptic neuron &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;′ to a post-synaptic neuron &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; can be decomposed into a sum of the true interaction from &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;′ to &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; plus corrections from every directed path from &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;′ to &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; through unobserved neurons. Importantly, the resulting formula reveals when the hidden units have—or do not have—major effects on reshaping the interactions among observed neurons. As a particular example of interest, we derive a formula for the impact of hidden units in random networks with “strong” coupling—connection weights that scale with 1 / N, where &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; is the network size, precisely the scaling observed in recent experiments. With this quantitative relationship between measured and true interactions, we can study how network properties shape effective interactions, which properties are relevant for neural computations, and how to manipulate effective interactions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iD53yQ24wOw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We have developed an easy-to-use and memory-efficient method called PhenotypeSeeker that (a) identifies phenotype-specific k-mers, (b) generates a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer-based statistical model for predicting a given phenotype and (c) predicts the phenotype from the sequencing data of a given bacterial isolate. The method was validated on 167 &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; isolates (virulence), 200 &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; isolates (ciprofloxacin resistance) and 459 &lt;i&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/i&gt; isolates (azithromycin resistance). The phenotype prediction models trained from these datasets obtained the F1-measure of 0.88 on the &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; test set, 0.88 on the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; test set and 0.97 on the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;difficile&lt;/i&gt; test set. The F1-measures were the same for assembled sequences and raw sequencing data; however, building the model from assembled genomes is significantly faster. On these datasets, the model building on a mid-range Linux server takes approximately 3 to 5 hours per phenotype if assembled genomes are used and 10 hours per phenotype if raw sequencing data are used. The phenotype prediction from assembled genomes takes less than one second per isolate. Thus, PhenotypeSeeker should be well-suited for predicting phenotypes from large sequencing datasets. PhenotypeSeeker is implemented in Python programming language, is open-source software and is available at GitHub (https://github.com/bioinfo-ut/PhenotypeSeeker/).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lD-D2JbSrjM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Nogo receptor-1 signaling is involved in the limitation of axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI) through collapsing the growth cone and inhibiting neurite outgrowth. Lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS), a Nogo receptor antagonist, suppresses these pathological conditions. A previous report demonstrated the positive effects of LOTUS expression on motor function through raphespinal tract regeneration using pan-neuronally LOTUS-overexpressing transgenic mice. However, this report used a hemi-section model, which does not represent the majority of clinical SCI cases, and lacked a detailed histological analysis of other descending tracts. To determine the true therapeutic effects of LOTUS, we used a more clinically relevant contusive SCI model in female transgenic mice. Definitive tracing analyses revealed that LOTUS promoted the extensive regeneration of the reticulospinal tract across the lesion site and suppressed axonal dieback of corticospinal tract (CST). A significant increase in raphespinal tract fibers was seen from the subacute to the chronic phase after the injury, strongly suggesting that LOTUS promoted translesional elongation of this tract. Furthermore, histological analyses revealed that LOTUS had a neuroprotective effect on the injured spinal cord through suppressing cellular apoptosis during the acute phase. These neuroprotective and regenerative effects contributed to significant motor functional recovery and restoration of the motor evoked potential. Therefore, LOTUS application could prove beneficial in the treatment of SCI by promoting axonal regeneration of some descending fibers, reducing axonal dieback of CST fibers and encouraging motor function recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI) is extremely limited due to Nogo receptor (NgR) signaling, which inhibits neurite outgrowth and collapses growth cones. Lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS), a NgR antagonist, suppresses this inhibition by NgR. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of LOTUS using a clinically relevant contusive SCI model. Our data revealed that LOTUS promoted extensive translesional regeneration of the reticulospinal and raphespinal tracts and rostral regeneration of the corticospinal tract. Furthermore, LOTUS suppressed cellular apoptosis during the acute phase, and these neuroprotective and regenerative effects contributed to significant recovery of motor function and nerve conduction. Therefore, this study suggested that LOTUS could aid the treatment of SCI by promoting axonal regeneration and motor function recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Exogenous Neural Precursor Cell Transplantation Results in Structural and Functional Recovery in a Hypoxic-Ischemic Hemiplegic Mouse Model</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Cerebral palsy (CP) is a common pediatric neurodevelopmental disorder, frequently resulting in motor and developmental deficits and often accompanied by cognitive impairments. A regular pathobiological hallmark of CP is oligodendrocyte maturation impairment resulting in white matter (WM) injury and reduced axonal myelination. Regeneration therapies based on cell replacement are currently limited, but neural precursor cells (NPCs), as cellular support for myelination, represent a promising regeneration strategy to treat CP, although the transplantation parameters (e.g. timing, dosage, mechanisms) remain to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We optimised a hemiplegic mouse model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia that mirrors the pathobiological hallmarks of CP and transplanted NPCs into the corpus callosum (CC), a major white matter structure impacted in CP patients. The NPCs survived, engrafted and differentiated morphologically in male and female mice. Histology and MRI showed repair of lesioned structures. Furthermore, electrophysiology revealed functional myelination of the CC (e.g. restoration of conduction velocity), while Cylinder and CatWalk tests demonstrated motor recovery of the affected forelimb. Endogenous oligodendrocytes, recruited in the CC following transplantation of exogenous NPCs, are the principal actors in this recovery process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of differentiation of the transplanted NPCs is consistent with enhanced recovery due to an indirect mechanism, such as a trophic and/or a &quot;bio-bridge&quot; support mediated by endogenous oligodendrocytes. Our work establishes that transplantation of NPCs represents a viable therapeutic strategy for CP treatment, and that the enhanced recovery is mediated by endogenous oligodendrocytes. This will further our understanding and contribute to the improvement of cellular therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most common pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting more than 17 million people worldwide. Current treatment options for CP are largely restricted to rehabilitative approaches that alleviate and mitigate symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Successful encoding during natural reading is associated with fixation-related potentials and large-scale network deactivation</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Reading literature (e.g., an entire book) is an enriching experience that qualitatively differs from reading a single sentence; however, the brain dynamics of such context-dependent memory remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate mnemonic neural dynamics during natural reading of literature by performing electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain activities of human participants recruited on campus were correlated with their subsequent memory, which was quantified by semantic correlation between the read text and reports subsequently written by them based on state of the art natural language processing procedures. The results of the EEG data analysis showed a significant positive relationship between subsequent memory and fixation-related EEG. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with N1-P2 and P3 fixation-related potential (FRP) components and fixation-related theta-band (4-8 Hz) EEG power, respectively. In contrast, the results of fMRI analysis showed a significant negative relationship between subsequent memory and blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) activation. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with networks of regions forming part of the salience network and the default mode network (DMN), respectively. Taken together with the EEG results, these memory-related deactivations in the salience network and the DMN were thought to reflect the reading of sentences characterized by low mnemonic load and the suppression of task-irreverent thoughts, respectively. It was suggested that the context-dependent mnemonic process during literature reading requires large-scale network deactivation, which might reflect coordination of a range of voluntary processes during reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Context-dependent memory encoding during natural reading of literature was evaluated using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on a subsequent memory paradigm. Subsequent memory was quantified by semantic correlation between the read text and reports subsequently written by the participants, based on a recent natural language processing procedure. Our results demonstrated a positive correlation between subsequent memory and fixation-related EEG and a negative correlation with fMRI activity. Sentence-length and paragraph-length processes were associated with regions belonging to the salience network and the default mode network, respectively. This is the first demonstration that memory encoding during literature reading is associated with large-scale network deactivations, which might reflect the coordination of a range of voluntary processes during reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;At this moment, databanks worldwide contain brain images of previously
unimaginable numbers. Combined with developments in data science, these massive
data provide the potential to better understand the genetic underpinnings of
brain diseases. However, different datasets, which are stored at different
institutions, cannot always be shared directly due to privacy and legal
concerns, thus limiting the full exploitation of big data in the study of brain
disorders. Here we propose a federated learning framework for securely
accessing and meta-analyzing any biomedical data without sharing individual
information. We illustrate our framework by investigating brain structural
relationships across diseases and clinical cohorts. The framework is first
tested on synthetic data and then applied to multi-centric, multi-database
studies including ADNI, PPMI, MIRIAD and UK Biobank, showing the potential of
the approach for further applications in distributed analysis of multi-centric
cohorts

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Beta-rhythm oscillations and synchronization transition in network models of Izhikevich neurons: effect of topology and synaptic type. (arXiv:1810.08488v1 [nlin.AO])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08488</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08488</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite their significant functional roles, beta-band oscillations are least
understood. Synchronization in neuronal networks have attracted much attention
in recent years with the main focus on transition type. Whether one obtains
explosive transition or a continuous transition is an important feature of the
neuronal network which can depend on network structure as well as synaptic
types. In this study we consider the effect of synaptic interaction (electrical
and chemical) as well as structural connectivity on synchronization transition
in network models of Izhikevich neurons which spike regularly with beta
rhythms. We find a wide range of behavior including continuous transition,
explosive transition, as well as lack of global order. The stronger electrical
synapses are more conducive to synchronization and can even lead to explosive
synchronization. The key network element which determines the order of
transition is found to be the clustering coefficient and not the small world
effect, or the existence of hubs in a network. These results are in contrast to
previous results which use phase oscillator models such as the Kuramoto model.
Furthermore, we show that the patterns of synchronization changes when one goes
to the gamma band. We attribute such a change to the change in the refractory
period of Izhikevich neurons which changes significantly with frequency.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06966</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06966</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks that learn to perform Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and related tasks using strictly local learning rules have been
previously derived based on the principle of similarity matching: similar pairs
of inputs should map to similar pairs of outputs. However, the operation of
these networks (and of similar networks) requires a fixed-point iteration to
determine the output corresponding to a given input, which means that dynamics
must operate on a faster time scale than the variation of the input. Further,
during these fast dynamics such networks typically &quot;disable&quot; learning, updating
synaptic weights only once the fixed-point iteration has been resolved. Here,
we derive a network for PCA-based dimensionality reduction that avoids this
fast fixed-point iteration. The key novelty of our approach is a modification
of the similarity matching objective to encourage near-diagonality of a
synaptic weight matrix. We then approximately invert this matrix using a Taylor
series approximation, replacing the previous fast iterations. In the offline
setting, our algorithm corresponds to a dynamical system, the stability of
which we rigorously analyze. In the online setting (i.e., with stochastic
gradients), we map our algorithm to a familiar neural network architecture and
give numerical results showing that our method converges at a competitive rate.
The computational complexity per iteration of our online algorithm is linear in
the total degrees of freedom, which is in some sense optimal.

	<description>The discovery of genomic imprinting by Davor Solter, Azim Surani and co-workers in the mid-1980s has provided a foundation for the study of epigenetic inheritance and the epigenetic control of gene activity and repression, especially during development. It also has shed light on a range of diseases, including both rare genetic disorders and common diseases. This article is being published to celebrate Solter and Surani receiving a 2018 Canada Gairdner International Award &quot;for the discovery of mammalian genomic imprinting that causes parent-of-origin specific gene expression and its consequences for development and disease&quot;.</description>

	<description>The discovery of the mechanisms underlying light-gated ion channels called channelrhodospins and the subsequent development of optogenetics illustrates how breakthroughs in science and technology can span multiple levels of scientific inquiry. Our knowledge of how channelrhodopsins work emerged from research at the microscopic level that investigated the structure and function of algal proteins. Optogenetics, on the other hand, exploits the power of channelrhodospins and similar proteins to investigate phenomena at the supra-macroscopic level, notably the neural circuits involved in animal behavior that may be relevant for understanding neuropsychiatric disease. This article is being published to celebrate Peter Hegemann, Karl Deisseroth and Ed Boyden receiving a 2018 Canada Gairdner International Award &quot;for the discovery of light-gated ion channel mechanisms, and for the discovery of optogenetics, a technology that has revolutionized neuroscience&quot;.</description>

	<description>Defining protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is central to the biological sciences. Here, we present a novel platform - Affinity Capture of Polyribosomes followed by RNA sequencing (ACAPseq) - for identifying PPIs. ACAPseq harnesses the power of massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to quantify the enrichment of polyribosomes based on the affinity of their associated nascent polypeptides for an immobilized protein ‘bait’. This method was developed and tested using neonatal mouse brain polyribosomes and a variety of extracellular domains as baits. Of 92 baits tested, 25 identified one or more binding partners that appear to be biologically relevant; additional candidate partners remain to be validated. ACAPseq can detect binding to targets that are present at less than 1 part in 100,000 in the starting polyribosome preparation. One of the observed PPIs was analyzed in detail, revealing the mode of homophilic binding for Protocadherin-9 (PCDH9), a non-clustered Protocadherin family member.</description>

	<description>Oomycete pathogens secrete host cell-entering effector proteins to manipulate host immunity during infection. We previously showed that PsAvh52, an early-induced RxLR effector secreted from the soybean root rot pathogen, &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora sojae&lt;/i&gt;, could suppress plant immunity. Here, we found that PsAvh52 is required for full virulence on soybean and binds to a novel soybean transacetylase, GmTAP1, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. PsAvh52 could cause GmTAP1 to relocate into the nucleus where GmTAP1 could acetylate histones H2A and H3 during early infection, thereby promoting susceptibility to &lt;i&gt;P. sojae&lt;/i&gt;. In the absence of PsAvh52, GmTAP1 remained confined to the cytoplasm and did not modify plant susceptibility. These results demonstrate that GmTAP1 is a susceptibility factor that is hijacked by PsAvh52 in order to promote epigenetic modifications that enhance the susceptibility of soybean to &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt; sojae &lt;/i&gt;infection.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Multiple neurons encode CrebB dependent appetitive long-term memory
                    in the mushroom body circuit</title>

	<description>Lasting changes in gene expression are critical for the formation of long-term                     memories (LTMs), depending on the conserved CrebB transcriptional activator.                     While requirement of distinct neurons in defined circuits for different learning                     and memory phases have been studied in detail, only little is known regarding                     the gene regulatory changes that occur within these neurons. We here use the                     fruit fly as powerful model system to study the neural circuits of                     CrebB-dependent appetitive olfactory LTM. We edited the &lt;i&gt;CrebB&lt;/i&gt;                     locus to create a GFP-tagged &lt;i&gt;CrebB&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockout allele,                     allowing us to generate mutant, post-mitotic neurons with high spatial and                     temporal precision. Investigating CrebB-dependence within the mushroom body (MB)                     circuit we show that MB α/β and α'/β' neurons as well as MBON α3, but not in                     dopaminergic neurons require CrebB for LTM. Thus, transcriptional memory traces                     occur in different neurons within the same neural circuit.</description>

	<description>To prepare timely motor actions we constantly predict future events. Regularly repeating events are often perceived as a rhythm to which we can readily synchronize our movements, just as in dancing to music. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the capacity to encode and maintain rhythms are not understood. We trained nonhuman primates to maintain the rhythm of a visual metronome of diverse tempos and recorded neural activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA). SMA exhibited rhythmic bursts of gamma band (30-40 Hz) reflecting an internal tempo that matched the extinguished visual metronome. Moreover, gamma amplitude increased throughout the trial, providing an estimate of total elapsed time. Notably, the timing of gamma bursts and firing rate modulations allowed predicting whether monkeys were ahead or behind the correct tempo. Our results indicate that SMA uses dynamic motor plans to encode a metronome for rhythms and a stopwatch for total elapsed time.</description>

	<description>In familiar environments, the firing fields of entorhinal grid cells form regular triangular lattices. However, when the geometric shape of the environment is deformed, these time-averaged grid patterns are distorted in a grid scale-dependent and local manner. We hypothesized that this distortion in part reflects dynamic anchoring of the grid code to displaced boundaries, possibly through border cell-grid cell interactions. To test this hypothesis, we first reanalyzed two existing rodent grid rescaling datasets to identify previously unrecognized boundary-tethered shifts in grid phase that contribute to the appearance of rescaling. We then demonstrated in a computational model that boundary-tethered phase shifts, as well as scale-dependent and local distortions of the time-averaged grid pattern, could emerge from border-grid interactions without altering inherent grid scale. Together, these results demonstrate that environmental deformations induce history-dependent shifts in grid phase, and implicate border-grid interactions as a potential mechanism underlying these dynamics.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37677</link>
	<description>One of the great challenges in biology is to understand the mechanisms by which morphogenetic processes arise from molecular activities. We investigated this problem in the context of actomyosin-based cortical flow in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; zygotes, where large-scale flows emerge from the collective action of actomyosin filaments and actin binding proteins (ABPs). Large-scale flow dynamics can be captured by active gel theory by considering force balances and conservation laws in the actomyosin cortex. However, which molecular activities contribute to flow dynamics and large-scale physical properties such as viscosity and active torque is largely unknown. By performing a candidate RNAi screen of ABPs and actomyosin regulators we demonstrate that perturbing distinct molecular processes can lead to similar flow phenotypes. This is indicative for a 'morphogenetic degeneracy' where multiple molecular processes contribute to the same large-scale physical property. We speculate that morphogenetic degeneracies contribute to the robustness of bulk biological matter in development.</description>

	<description>Distinct anatomical and spectral channels are thought to play specialized roles in the communication within cortical networks. While activity in the alpha and beta frequency range (7 – 40 Hz) is thought to predominantly originate from infragranular cortical layers conveying feedback-related information, activity in the gamma range (&amp;gt;40 Hz) dominates in supragranular layers communicating feedforward signals. We leveraged high precision MEG to test this proposal, directly and non-invasively, in human participants performing visually cued actions. We found that visual alpha mapped onto deep cortical laminae, whereas visual gamma predominantly occurred more superficially. This lamina-specificity was echoed in movement-related sensorimotor beta and gamma activity. These lamina-specific pre- and post- movement changes in sensorimotor beta and gamma activity suggest a more complex functional role than the proposed feedback and feedforward communication in sensory cortex. Distinct frequency channels thus operate in a lamina-specific manner across cortex, but may fulfill distinct functional roles in sensory and motor processes.</description>

	<description>Metacognition plays a pivotal role in human development. The ability to realize that we do not know something, or meta-ignorance, emerges after approximately five years of age. We aimed at identifying the brain systems that underlie the developmental emergence of this ability in a preschool sample. Twenty-four children aged between five and six years answered questions under three conditions of a meta-ignorance task twice. In the critical partial knowledge condition, an experimenter first showed two toys to a child, then announced that she would place one of them in a box behind a screen, out of sight from the child. The experimenter then asked the child whether or not she knew which toy was in the box. Children who answered correctly both times to the metacognitive question in the partial knowledge condition (n=9) showed greater cortical thickness in a cluster within left medial orbitofrontal cortex than children who did not (n=15). Further, seed-based functional connectivity analyses of the brain during resting state revealed that this region is functionally connected to the medial orbitofrontal gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus, and mid- and inferior temporal gyri. This finding suggests that the default mode network, critically through its prefrontal regions, supports introspective processing. It leads to the emergence of metacognitive monitoring allowing children to explicitly report their own ignorance.</description>

	<description>A randomized controlled trial compared complex span and n-back training regimes to investigate the generality of training benefits across materials and paradigms. The memory items and training intensities were equated across programs, providing the first like-with-like comparison of transfer in these two widely-used training paradigms. The stimuli in transfer tests of verbal and visuo-spatial n-back and complex span differed from the trained tasks, but were matched across the untrained paradigms. Pre-to-post changes were observed for untrained n-back tasks following n-back training. Following complex span training there was equivocal evidence for improvements on a verbal complex span task, but no evidence for changes on an untrained visuo-spatial complex span activity. Relative to a no intervention group, the evidence supported no change on an untrained verbal complex span task following either n-back or complex span training. Equivocal evidence was found for improvements on visuo-spatial complex span and verbal and visuo-spatial n-back tasks following both training regimes. Evidence for selective transfer (comparing the two active training groups) was only found for an untrained visuo-spatial n-back task following n-back training. There was no evidence for cross-paradigm transfer. Thus transfer is constrained by working memory paradigm and the nature of individual processes executed within complex span tasks. However, within-paradigm transfer can occur when the change is limited to stimulus category, at least for n-back.</description>

	<description>ADHD is associated with altered dopamine regulated reinforcement learning on prediction errors. Despite evidence of categorically altered error processing in ADHD, neuroimaging advances have largely investigated models of normal reinforcement learning in greater detail. Further, although reinforcement leaning critically relies on ventral striatum exerting error magnitude related thresholding influences on substantia nigra (SN) and dorsal striatum, these thresholding influences have never been identified with neuroimaging. To identify such thresholding influences, we propose that error magnitude related activities must first be separated from opposite activities in overlapping neural regions during error detection. Here we separate error detection from magnitude related adjustment (post-error slowing) during inhibition errors in the stop signal task in typically developing (TD) and ADHD adolescents using fMRI. In TD, we predicted that: 1) deactivation of dorsal striatum on error detection interrupts ongoing processing, and should be proportional to right frontoparietal response phase activity that has been observed in the SST; 2) deactivation of ventral striatum on post-error slowing exerts thresholding influences on, and should be proportional to activity in dorsal striatum. In ADHD, we predicted that ventral striatum would instead correlate with heightened amygdala responses to errors. We found deactivation of dorsal striatum on error detection correlated with response-phase activity in both groups. In TD, post-error slowing deactivation of ventral striatum correlated with activation of dorsal striatum. In ADHD, ventral striatum correlated with heightened amygdala activity. Further, heightened activities in locus coeruleus (norepinephrine), raphe nucleus (serotonin) and medial septal nuclei (acetylcholine), which all compete for control of DA, and are altered in ADHD, exhibited altered correlations with SN. All correlations in TD were replicated in healthy adults. Results in TD are consistent with dopamine regulated reinforcement learning on post-error slowing. In ADHD, results are consistent with heightened activities in the amygdala and non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter nuclei preventing reinforcement learning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Trem2 promotes anti-inflammatory responses in microglia and is suppressed under pro-inflammatory conditions</title>

	<description>Recent genome-wide association studies have reported that, amongst other microglial genes, variants in TREM2 can profoundly increase the incidence of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have investigated the role of TREM2 in primary microglial cultures from wild-type mice by using siRNA to decrease Trem2 expression, and in parallel from knock-in mice heterozygous or homozygous for the Trem2 R47H AD risk variant (from the Jackson laboratories). The prevailing phenotype of Trem2 R47H knock-in mice was decreased expression levels of Trem2 in microglia, which resulted in decreased density of microglia in the hippocampus. Overall, primary microglia with reduced Trem2 expression, either by siRNA or from the R47H knock-in mice, displayed a similar phenotype. Comparison of the effects of decreased Trem2 expression under conditions of LPS pro-inflammatory or IL4 anti-inflammatory stimulation revealed the importance of Trem2 in driving a number of the genes up-regulated in the anti-inflammatory phenotype, whether treated with RNAi or performed with microglia carrying the R47H variant. In particular, Trem2 knockdown decreased levels of the transcription factor STAT6. STAT6 is the key mediator downstream from IL4 and controls expression of genes including Arg1, which also showed decreased IL4-induced expression when Trem2 expression was decreased. LPS-induced pro-inflammatory stimulation suppressed Trem2 expression, thus preventing TREM2's anti-inflammatory drive. The importance of Trem2 activity in regulating the pro- and anti-inflammatory balance of microglia, particularly mediating effects of the IL4-regulated anti-inflammatory pathway, has important implications for fighting neurodegenerative disease.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The impact of bilingualism on executive functions and working memory in young adults.</title>

	<description>A bilingual advantage in a form of a better performance of bilinguals in tasks tapping into executive function abilities has been reported repeatedly in the literature. However, recent research defends that this advantage does not stem from bilingualism, but from uncontrolled factors or imperfectly matched samples. In this study we explored the potential impact of bilingualism on executive functioning abilities by testing large groups of young adult bilinguals and monolinguals in the tasks that were most extensively used when the advantages were reported. Importantly, the recently identified factors that could be disrupting the between groups comparisons were controlled for, and both groups were matched. We found no differences between groups in their performance. Additional bootstrapping analyses indicated that, when the bilingual advantage appeared, it very often co-occurred with unmatched socio-demographic factors. The evidence presented here indicates that the bilingual advantage might indeed be caused by spurious uncontrolled factors rather than bilingualism per se. Secondly, bilingualism has been argued to potentially affect working memory also. Therefore, we tested the same participants in both a forward and a backward version of a visual and an auditory working memory task. We found no differences between groups in either of the forward versions of the tasks, but bilinguals systematically outperformed monolinguals in the backward conditions. The results are analyzed and interpreted taking into consideration different perspectives in the domain-specificity of the executive functions and working memory.</description>

	<description>Conscious perception is theorized to involve a large-scale, coordinated activation of distant brain regions, a process termed ignition in the influential Global Workspace Theory of consciousness. Here, we provide evidence for the ignition process in humans by combining a magnetically-induced phosphene perception task with dense-electroencephalography. Functional cortical networks were identified and characterized using graph-theoretical analysis to quantify the impact of conscious perception on local (segregation) and distant (integration, key to ignition) processing. Conscious phosphene perception activated frequency-specific networks, each associated with a spatial scale of information processing: integration increased within an alpha-band functional network, versus a beta-band functional network for segregation. We speculate that such stimulus-induced modulation of the frequency-specific networks characterizing ignition could be exploited to assess non-invasively residual consciousness in minimally conscious patients.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Striking reduction in neurons and glial cells in anterior thalamic nuclei of older patients with Down\'s syndrome</title>

	<description>The anterior thalamic nuclei are important for spatial and episodic memory; however, there is surprisingly little information about how these nuclei are affected in many conditions that present with memory impairments, including Down syndrome. To assess the status of the anterior thalamic nuclei in Down syndrome we quantified neurons and glial cells in the brains from four older patients with this condition. There was a striking reduction in the volume of the anterior thalamic nuclei and this appeared to reflect the loss of approximately 70% of neurons. The number of glial cells was also reduced but to a lesser degree than neurons. The anterior thalamic nuclei appear to be particularly sensitive to effects of aging in Down syndrome and the pathology in this region likely contributes to the memory impairments observed. These findings re-affirm the importance of assessing the status of the anterior thalamic nuclei in conditions where memory impairments have been principally assigned to pathology in the medial temporal lobe.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cortico-brainstem mechanisms of biased perceptual decision-making in the context of pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/449652v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/449652v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Perceptual decision-making is commonly studied using stimuli with different physical properties but of comparable affective value. Here, we investigate neural processes underlying human perceptual decisions in the affectively rich domain of pain using a drift-diffusion model in combination with a probabilistic cueing paradigm. This allowed us to characterize a novel role for the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), whose anticipatory responses reflecting a decision bias were dependent on the affective value of the stimulus. During intense noxious stimulation, these model-based anticipatory DLPFC responses were linked to an engagement of the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a midbrain region implicated in defensive responses including analgesia. Complementing these findings on biased decision-making, the model parameter reflecting sensory processing predicted subcortical responses (in amygdala and PAG) when expectations were violated. Our findings highlight the importance of taking a broader perspective on perceptual decisions and link decisions about pain with subcortical circuitry implicated in endogenous pain modulation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Predicting the future with multi-scale successor representations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/449470v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The successor representation (SR) is a candidate principle for generalization in reinforcement learning, computational accounts of memory, and the structure of neural representations in the hippocampus. Given a sequence of states, the SR learns a predictive representation for every given state that encodes how often, on average, each upcoming state is expected to be visited, even if it is multiple steps ahead. A discount or scale parameter determines how many steps into the future SR's generalizations reach, enabling rapid value computation, subgoal discovery, and flexible decision-making in large trees. However, SR with a single scale could discard information for predicting both the sequential order of and the distance between states, which are common problems in navigation for animals and artificial agents. Here we propose a solution: an ensemble of SRs with multiple scales. We show that the derivative of multi-scale SR can reconstruct both the sequence of expected future states and estimate distance to goal. This derivative can be computed linearly: we show that a multi-scale SR ensemble is the Laplace transform of future states, and the inverse of this Laplace transform is a biologically plausible linear estimation of the derivative. Multi-scale SR and its derivative could lead to a common principle for how the medial temporal lobe supports both map-based and vector-based navigation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Complement 3 signaling is necessary for the developmental refinement of olfactory bulb circuitry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/449454v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/449454v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The olfactory system depends upon organizational maps that are developmentally refined and maintained, however the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes are unknown. Studies have shown that microglia and complement molecules are important for the developmental refinement of circuitry within the visual system, thus we asked whether they played a similar role in the olfactory system through the formation of the olfactory bulb (OB) maps, the glomerular and intrabulbar maps. Our findings revealed that microglia in mature animals engulf olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) axons and the synaptic terminals of tufted cells in the glomerular and intrabulbar maps respectively, suggesting microglia could anatomically shape the mature OB circuitry. To determine the mechanisms underlying this axonal pruning activity we used complement 3 (C3) and complement receptor 3 (CR3) knockout mice to investigate if C3 signaling was necessary for precise OB map development. Our results demonstrate that glomerular and intrabulbar map disorganization as typically present in early postnatal mice persists into adulthood when C3 signaling is disrupted. These data clearly establish the C3/CR3 pathway as necessary for the proper developmental refinement of both olfactory maps. We further present the olfactory system as a unique platform to study the role of glia in the development and adult refinement of regenerating circuits.</description>

	<description>Distributed circuits like the olfactory cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum contain sub-circuits whose inputs distribute their axons over the entire circuit creating a puzzle of how information is encoded. One method for approaching the puzzle is to view them as scalable systems. In scalable systems the quantitative relationship between circuit components is conserved across brain sizes, and by mapping circuit size to functional abilities - e.g. visual acuity in the visual circuit - scientists have explained information encoding. This approach has not been applied to anti-map circuits as their scalability is unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we obtained quantitative descriptions of the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex in six mammals using stereology techniques and light microscopy. We found that the olfactory circuit is scalable as it satisfies three requirements of scalable systems. First, quantitative relationships between circuit components are conserved: the number piriform neurons n scales with bulb glomeruli g as n ~ g3/2. Second, the olfactory circuit has an invariant property: the average number of synapses between a bulb glomerulus and piriform neuron is one. Third, the olfactory circuit is symmorphic, i.e. olfactory ability improves with circuit size. Other distributed circuits with similar properties might also be scalable.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A conserved principle of glial organization in the paleocortex and neocortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/449421v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/449421v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Neocortical and paleocortical neurons perform complex computations that depend on the architecture of the circuits and the environment in which they are embedded. The environment is largely governed by glial cells, and previous work has shown that the number of glial cells under a square mm depends on thickness of the neocortex, irrespective of the species. We wondered if this might be a principle of glial organization. To this end, we investigated if the paleocortex, which differs from the neocortex in its architecture, nevertheless obeys the same principle. We quantified the number of glial cells in the anterior piriform cortex, a paleocortical circuit subserving olfaction, across six mammalian species, using stereology and light microscopy. We found two orderly relationships across species. First, just like the neocortex, the number of glial cells per mm2 increased proportionally with cortical thickness, although the paleocortex had a higher density of glial cells. Second, the number of glia was proportional to piriform cortex size, indicating a conserved principle of organization across species. In conclusion, our findings show that glial cells are organized similarly neo- and paleocortices, although at different densities, likely reflecting local computational demands.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Targeted memory reactivation during sleep elicits neural signals related to learning content</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/449389v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/449389v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Reactivation of learning-related neural activity patterns is thought to drive memory stabilization. However, finding reliable, non-invasive, content-specific indicators of reactivation remains a central challenge. Here, we attempted to decode the content of reactivated memories in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during sleep. During encoding, human participants learned to associate spatial locations of visual objects with left- or right-hand movements, and each object was accompanied by an inherently related sound. During subsequent slow-wave sleep within an afternoon nap, we presented half of the sound cues that were associated (during wake) with left- and right-hand movements before bringing participants back for a final post-nap test. We trained a classifier on sleep EEG data (focusing on lateralized EEG features that discriminated left- vs. right-sided trials during wake) to predict learning content when we reactivated the memories during sleep. Discrimination performance was significantly above chance and predicted subsequent memory, supporting the idea that reactivation leads to memory stabilization. Moreover, these lateralized signals increased with post-cue spindle power, demonstrating that reactivation has a strong relationship with spindles. These results show that lateralized activity related to individual memories can be decoded from sleep EEG, providing an effective indicator of offline reactivation.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Numerous types of inhibitory neurons sculpt the performance of human neocortical circuits, with each type exhibiting a constellation of subcellular phenotypic features in support of its specialized functions. Axonal myelination has been absent among the characteristics used to distinguish inhibitory neuron types; in fact, very little is known about myelinated inhibitory axons in human neocortex. Here, using array tomography to analyze samples of neurosurgically excised human neocortex, we show that inhibitory myelinated axons originate predominantly from parvalbumin-containing interneurons. Compared to myelinated excitatory axons, they have higher neurofilament and lower microtubule content, shorter nodes of Ranvier, and more myelin basic protein (MBP) in their myelin sheath. Furthermore, these inhibitory axons have more mitochondria, likely to sustain the high energy demands of parvalbumin interneurons, as well as more 2’,3’-cyclic nucleotide 3’-phosphodiesterase (CNP), a protein enriched in the myelin cytoplasmic channels that are thought to facilitate the delivery of nutrients from ensheathing oligodendrocytes. Our results demonstrate that myelinated axons of parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons exhibit distinctive features that may support the specialized functions of this neuron type in human neocortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Rodents actively whisk their vibrissae, which, when they come in contact with surrounding objects, enables rodents to gather spatial information about the environment. Cortical motor command of whisking is crucial for the control of vibrissa movement. Using awake and head-fixed rats, we investigated the correlations between axonal projection patterns and firing properties in identified layer 5 neurons in the motor cortex, which are associated with vibrissa movement. We found that cortical neurons that sent axons to the brainstem fired preferentially during large-amplitude vibrissa movements and that corticocallosal neurons exhibited a high firing rate during small vibrissa movements or during a quiet state. The differences between these two corticofugal circuits may be related to the mechanisms of motor-associated information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Memory formation is a protracted process that initially involves the hippocampus and becomes increasingly dependent on the cortex over time, but the mechanisms of this transfer are unclear. We recently showed that hippocampal depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z enhances both recent and remote memories, but the use of virally-mediated depletion reduced H2A.Z levels throughout testing, making its temporally-specific function unclear. Given the lack of drugs that target histone variants, we tested existing drugs for efficacy against H2A.Z, based on their targeting of known H2A.Z regulators. The Tip60 (part of H2A.Z deposition complex) inhibitor Nu9056 reduced H2A.Z binding, whereas the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor TSA increased H2A.Z acetylation without influencing total H2A.Z in cultured hippocampal neurons. Tip60 (but not HDAC) inhibition 23h after learning enhanced remote (tested at 7 days) and not recent (tested at 24 hours) contextual fear memory in mice. In contrast, Tip60 inhibition 30 days after learning impaired recall of remote memory after 1h, but protected the memory from further declining 24h later. These data provide the first evidence of a delayed post-learning role for histone variants in supporting memory transfer during systems consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the molecular basis of memory is fundamental for developing novel therapies for memory decline, but progress is impeded by the presence of multiple stages of memory formation that may involve unique molecular events. Our data identify a new time point, 24h after learning, at which H2A.Z manipulation selectively impacts remote memory without influencing recent memory. This finding advances our understanding of memory for several reasons: 1) It demonstrates that ongoing epigenetic changes exert stage-specific outcomes on memory formation, and 2) It provides the first pharmacological tool for manipulating H2A.Z binding. Moreover, we show that Tip60 influences memory through effects that involve H2A.Z, which suggests that recent studies of Tip60-mediated plasticity may include actions on this histone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: p11 in cholinergic interneurons of the nucleus accumbens is essential for dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A recent study showed that p11 expressed in cholinergic interneurons (CINs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key regulator of depression-like behaviors. Dopaminergic neurons projecting to the NAc are responsible for reward-related behaviors, and their function is impaired in depression. The present study investigated the role of p11 in NAc CINs in dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The extracellular dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the NAc were determined in freely moving male mice using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microdialysis. Rewarding stimuli (cocaine, palatable food and female mouse encounter) induced an increase in dopamine efflux in the NAc of wild-type mice. The dopamine responses were attenuated (cocaine) or abolished (food and female mouse encounter) in constitutive p11 KO mice. The dopamine response to cocaine was accompanied by an increase in ACh NAc efflux, whereas the attenuated dopamine response to cocaine in p11 KO mice was restored by activation of nicotinic or muscarinic ACh receptors in the NAc. Dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli and ACh release in the NAc were attenuated in mice with deletion of p11 from cholinergic neurons (ChAT-p11 cKO mice), whereas gene delivery of p11 to CINs restored the dopamine responses. Furthermore, chemogenetic studies revealed that p11 is required for activation of CINs in response to rewarding stimuli. Thus, p11 in NAc CINs plays a critical role in activating these neurons to mediate dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The dysregulation of mesolimbic dopamine system by dysfunction of p11 in NAc CINs may be involved in pathogenesis of depressive states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; p11 is a critical regulator of CIN activity as measured by the dopamine response of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway to rewarding stimuli. p11 is required for reward-mediated NAc CIN activation and induction in ACh release, resulting in the enhancement of dopamine release. The reduction of p11 expression in NAc CINs is tightly associated with anhedonia as well as other depression-like symptoms of behavioral despair. To improve therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants for anhedonia, a new type of antidepressant directly or indirectly acting on the mesolimbic dopamine pathway needs to be developed. For this purpose, therapeutic strategies that increase the function of p11 and its signaling pathway in NAc CINs may have an impact on antidepressant efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Excitatory synapses are often formed at small protrusions of dendrite, called dendritic spines, in most projection neurons, and the spine-head volumes show strong correlations with synaptic connectivity. We examined the dynamics of spine volume in the adult mouse visual cortex using time-lapse &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon imaging with a resonant Galvano scanner. Contrary to expectations, we found that the spines in the adult neocortex showed fluctuations to a similar degree as that observed in young hippocampal preparations, but there were systematic differences in how the dynamics were dependent on spine volumes, thus allowing for fewer fluctuations in small spines, which could account for the relatively low turnover rates of neocortical spines &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We found that spine volumes fluctuated to a greater extent in a mouse model (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knockout) of fragile X mental retardation than in wild-type mice, and the spine turnover rates were also higher in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice. Such features of spine dynamics in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice could be represented by a single slope factor in our model. Our data and model indicate a small but significant change in the average spine volume and more eminent differences in the statistical distribution in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice even in adulthood, which reflects the abnormal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; dynamics of spine volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Excitatory synapses are often formed at dendritic spines in projection neurons, and the spine volumes show strong correlations with synaptic connectivity. We studied the dynamics of spine volumes &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; using a resonant scanner two-photon microscope, and found that spine dynamics showed a distinctive dependence on spine volume in the adult neocortex, allowing for fewer fluctuations in these small spines than in the spines of young hippocampi. Moreover, the dynamics of spine volumes explained the greater turnover rate of spines and the smaller spine volume observed in a mouse model (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knockout) of fragile X syndrome mental retardation than in wild-type mice. Our results indicate that the dynamics of spine volumes are abnormal in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice, even in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Inhibition of pyramidal neurons in the basal amygdala promotes fear learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0272-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;The basolateral amygdala (BLA) complex, which contains the lateral (LA) and basal (BA) sub-nuclei, is a critical substrate of associative learning related to reward and aversive stimuli. Auditory fear conditioning studies in rodents have shown that the excitation of LA pyramidal neurons, driven by the inhibition of local GABAergic interneurons, is critical to fear memory formation. Studies examining the role of the BA in auditory fear conditioning, however, have yielded divergent outcomes. Here, we used a neuron-specific chemogenetic approach to manipulate the excitability of mouse BA neurons during auditory fear conditioning. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of BA GABA neurons, but not BA pyramidal neurons, impaired fear learning. Further, either chemogenetic stimulation of BA GABA neurons or chemogenetic inhibition of BA pyramidal neurons was sufficient to generate the formation of an association between a behavior and a neutral auditory cue. This chemogenetic memory required presentation of a discrete cue, and was not attributable to an effect of BA pyramidal neuron inhibition on general freezing behavior, locomotor activity, or anxiety. Collectively, these data suggest that BA GABA neuron activation and the subsequent inhibition of BA pyramidal neurons play important role in fear learning. Moreover, the roles of inhibitory signaling differ between the LA and BA, with excitation of pyramidal neurons promoting memory formation in the former, and inhibition of pyramidal neurons playing this role in the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The basolateral amygdala (BLA) complex, which consists of lateral (LA) and basal (BA) sub-nuclei, is a critical substrate of associative learning. While inhibition of GABAergic interneurons and subsequent disinhibition of pyramidal neurons in the LA is critical to fear learning, the contribution of the BA is less clear. Here, we used a chemogenetic approach to manipulate pyramidal and GABA neuron excitability in the BA during fear conditioning. We found that BA GABA neuron activity is necessary for fear learning, and that BA GABA neuron stimulation or BA pyramidal neuron inhibition can induce an association between a behavior and an auditory cue. These findings expand our understanding of the fear learning circuitry and highlight a novel role for inhibitory signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Carriage of Supernumerary Sex Chromosomes Decreases the Volume and Alters the Shape of Limbic Structures</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA) enhances risk for several psychiatric disorders associated with the limbic system, including mood and autism spectrum disorders. These patients provide a powerful genetics-first model for understanding the biological basis of psychopathology. Additionally, these disorders are frequently sex-biased in prevalence, further suggesting an etiological role for sex chromosomes. To clarify how limbic anatomy varies across sex and sex chromosome complement, we characterized amygdala and hippocampus structure in a uniquely large sample of patients carrying supernumerary sex chromosomes (n = 132) and typically developing controls (n=166). After adjustment for sex-differences in brain size, karyotypically normal males (XY) and females (XX) did not differ in volume or shape of either structure. In contrast, all SCAs were associated with lowered amygdala volume relative to gonadally-matched controls. This effect was robust to three different methods for total brain volume adjustment, including an allometric analysis that derived normative scaling rules for these structures in a separate, typically developing population (n = 79). Hippocampal volume was insensitive to SCA after adjustment for total brain volume. However, surface-based analysis revealed that SCA, regardless of specific karyotype, was consistently associated with a spatially specific pattern of shape change in both amygdala and hippocampus. In particular, SCA was accompanied by contraction around the basomedial nucleus of the amygdala and an area within the hippocampal surface that cuts across hippocampal subfields. These results demonstrate the power of SCA as a model to understand how copy number variation can precipitate changes in brain systems relevant to psychiatric disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In approximately 1 per 500 live births, infants are born carrying extra X- or Y-chromosomes. These conditions, known as sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCA), are associated with elevated risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and autism. In our study, we leverage a uniquely large dataset of brain scans from SCA patients to characterize how SCA influences the structure of the amygdala and hippocampus, which have been strongly implicated in many SCA-linked neuropsychiatric disorders. Across our different patient groups, we find converging evidence that SCA is associated with a decrease in amygdala volume, and spatially specific areal contractions in both the amygdala and hippocampus. Our findings help clarify how genetic copy number variation associated with psychiatric disease shapes brain organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Liquefaction of the brain following stroke shares a similar molecular and morphological profile with atherosclerosis and mediates secondary neurodegeneration in an osteopontin dependent mechanism</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Here we used mouse models of heart and brain ischemia to compare the inflammatory response to ischemia in the heart, a protein rich organ, to the inflammatory response to ischemia in the brain, a lipid rich organ. We report that ischemia-induced inflammation resolves between 1 and 4 weeks in the heart compared to between 8 and 24 weeks in the brain. Importantly, we discovered that a second burst of inflammation occurs in the brain between 4 and 8 weeks following ischemia, which coincided with the appearance of cholesterol crystals within the infarct. This second wave shares a similar cellular and molecular profile with atherosclerosis and is characterized by high levels of osteopontin (OPN) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In order to test the role of OPN in areas of liquefactive necrosis, OPN&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice were subjected to brain ischemia. We found that at 7 weeks following stroke, the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins and MMPs was profoundly reduced in the infarct of the OPN&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, although the number of cholesterol crystals was increased. OPN&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited faster recovery of motor function and a higher number of neuronal nuclei (NeuN) positive cells in the peri-infarct area at 7 weeks following stroke. Based on these findings we propose that the brain liquefies after stroke because phagocytic cells in the infarct are unable to efficiently clear cholesterol rich myelin debris, and that this leads to the perpetuation of an OPN-dependent inflammatory response characterized by high levels of degradative enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The inflammatory response to ischemia in the brain is different to the response to ischemic injury in other organs. In the brain, and for unknown reasons, dead tissue liquefies in response to ischemia by the process of liquefactive necrosis. However, the data we present here demonstrate that there is overlap between the pathophysiology of liquefactive necrosis and atherosclerosis. Specifically, we show that chronic stroke infarcts contain foamy macrophages, cholesterol crystals, high levels of OPN and MMPs, and a similar cytokine profile to atherosclerosis. Therefore, because cholesterol is a central component of myelin, liquefactive necrosis in response to stroke may be caused by an inflammatory response to cholesterol-rich myelin debris that is driven in large part by OPN and MMPs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Wave to pulse generation. From oscillatory synapse to train of action potentials. (arXiv:1810.08056v1 [physics.bio-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08056</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08056</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons have the capability of transforming information from a digital signal
at the dendrites of the presynaptic termi- nal to an analogous wave at the
synaptic cleft and back to a digital pulse when they achieve the required
voltage for the generation of an action potential at the postsynaptic neuron.
The main question of this research is what processes are generating the
oscillatory wave signal at the synaptic cleft and what is the best model for
this phenomenon. Here, it is proposed a model of the synapse as an oscillatory
system capable of synchronization taking into account conservation of
information and consequently of frequency at the interior of the synaptic
cleft. Trains of action potentials certainly encode and transmit information
along the nervous system but most of the time neurons are not transmitting
action potentials, 99 percent of their time neurons are in the sub threshold
regime were only small signals without the energy to emanate an action
potential are carrying the majority of information. The proposed model for a
synapse, smooths the train of action potential and keeps its frequency.
Synapses are presented here as a system composed of an input wave that is
transformed through interferometry. The collective synaptic interference
pattern of waves will reflect the points of maximum amplitude for the density
wave synaptic function were the location of the &quot;particle&quot; in our case action
potential, has its highest probability.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, and
behavioral treatment interventions have shown promise for young children with
ASD. However, there is limited progress in understanding the effect of each
type of treatment. In this project, we aim to detect structural changes in the
brain after treatment and select structural features associated with treatment
outcomes. The difficulty in building large databases of patients who have
received specific treatments and the high dimensionality of medical image
analysis problems are the challenges in this work. To select predictive
features and build accurate models, we use the sure independence screening
(SIS) method. SIS is a theoretically and empirically validated method for
ultra-high dimensional general linear models, and it achieves both predictive
accuracy and correct feature selection by iterative feature selection. Compared
with step-wise feature selection methods, SIS removes multiple features in each
iteration and is computationally efficient. Compared with other linear models
such as elastic-net regression, support vector regression (SVR) and partial
least squares regression (PSLR), SIS achieves higher accuracy. We validated the
superior performance of SIS in various experiments: First, we extract brain
structural features from FreeSurfer, including cortical thickness, surface
area, mean curvature and cortical volume. Next, we predict different measures
of treatment outcomes based on structural features. We show that SIS achieves
the highest correlation between prediction and measurements in all tasks.
Furthermore, we report regions selected by SIS as biomarkers for ASD.

Here we report five crystal structures of DNA polymerase I that capture new conformations for the polymerase translocation and nucleotide pre-insertion steps in the DNA synthesis pathway.

RAVEN is a commonly used MATLAB toolbox for genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) reconstruction, curation and constraint-based modelling and simulation. Here we present RAVEN Toolbox 2.0 with major enhancements, including: (i) &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; reconstruction of GEMs based on the MetaCyc pathway database; (ii) a redesigned KEGG-based reconstruction pipeline; (iii) convergence of reconstructions from various sources; (iv) improved performance, usability, and compatibility with the COBRA Toolbox. Capabilities of RAVEN 2.0 are here illustrated through &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; reconstruction of GEMs for the antibiotic-producing bacterium &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/i&gt;. Comparison of the automated &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; reconstructions with the iMK1208 model, a previously published high-quality &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coelicolor&lt;/i&gt; GEM, exemplifies that RAVEN 2.0 can capture most of the manually curated model. The generated &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; reconstruction is subsequently used to curate iMK1208 resulting in Sco4, the most comprehensive GEM of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coelicolor&lt;/i&gt;, with increased coverage of both primary and secondary metabolism. This increased coverage allows the use of Sco4 to predict novel genome editing targets for optimized secondary metabolites production. As such, we demonstrate that RAVEN 2.0 can be used not only for &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; GEM reconstruction, but also for curating existing models based on up-to-date databases. Both RAVEN 2.0 and Sco4 are distributed through GitHub to facilitate usage and further development by the community (https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN and https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Streptomyces_coelicolor-GEM).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kidUMXJNwMA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling large fluctuations of thousands of clones during hematopoiesis: The role of stem cell self-renewal and bursty progenitor dynamics in rhesus macaque</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006489</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Song Xu, Sanggu Kim, Irvin S. Y. Chen, Tom Chou&lt;/p&gt;

In a recent clone-tracking experiment, millions of uniquely tagged hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were autologously transplanted into rhesus macaques and peripheral blood containing thousands of tags were sampled and sequenced over 14 years to quantify the abundance of hundreds to thousands of tags or “clones.” Two major puzzles of the data have been observed: consistent differences and massive temporal fluctuations of clone populations. The large sample-to-sample variability can lead clones to occasionally go “extinct” but “resurrect” themselves in subsequent samples. Although heterogeneity in HSC differentiation rates, potentially due to tagging, and random sampling of the animals’ blood and cellular demographic stochasticity might be invoked to explain these features, we show that random sampling cannot explain the magnitude of the temporal fluctuations. Moreover, we show through simpler &lt;i&gt;neutral&lt;/i&gt; mechanistic and statistical models of hematopoiesis of tagged cells that a broad distribution in clone sizes can arise from stochastic HSC self-renewal instead of tag-induced heterogeneity. The very large clone population fluctuations that often lead to extinctions and resurrections can be naturally explained by a generation-limited proliferation constraint on the progenitor cells. This constraint leads to bursty cell population dynamics underlying the large temporal fluctuations. We analyzed experimental clone abundance data using a new statistic that counts clonal disappearances and provided least-squares estimates of two key model parameters in our model, the total HSC differentiation rate and the maximum number of progenitor-cell divisions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hrgk_-GnzwY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Virus and CTL dynamics in the extrafollicular and follicular tissue compartments in SIV-infected macaques</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006461</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/xkNLNCfLeo0/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Dominik Wodarz, Pamela J. Skinner, David N. Levy, Elizabeth Connick&lt;/p&gt;

Data from SIV-infected macaques indicate that virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are mostly present in the extrafollicular (EF) compartment of the lymphoid tissue, with reduced homing to the follicular (F) site. This contributes to the majority of the virus being present in the follicle and represents a barrier to virus control. Using mathematical models, we investigate these dynamics. Two models are analyzed. The first assumes that CTL can only become stimulated and expand in the extrafollicular compartment, with migration accounting for the presence of CTL in the follicle. In the second model, follicular CTL can also undergo antigen-induced expansion. Consistent with experimental data, both models predict increased virus compartmentalization in the presence of stronger CTL responses and lower virus loads, and a more pronounced rise of extrafollicular compared to follicular virus during CD8 cell depletion experiments. The models, however, differ in other aspects. The follicular expansion model results in dynamics that promote the clearance of productive infection in the extrafollicular site, with any productively infected cells found being the result of immigration from the follicle. This is not observed in the model without follicular CTL expansion. The models further predict different consequences of introducing engineered, follicular-homing CTL, which has been proposed as a therapeutic means to improve virus control. Without follicular CTL expansion, this is predicted to result in a reduction of virus load in both compartments. The follicular CTL expansion model, however, makes the counter-intuitive prediction that addition of F-homing CTL not only results in a reduction of follicular virus load, but also in an increase in extrafollicular virus replication. These predictions remain to be experimentally tested, which will be relevant for distinguishing between models and for understanding how therapeutic introduction of F-homing CTL might impact the overall dynamics of the infection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xkNLNCfLeo0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A multi-scale layer-resolved spiking network model of resting-state dynamics in macaque visual cortical areas</title>

Cortical activity has distinct features across scales, from the spiking statistics of individual cells to global resting-state networks. We here describe the first full-density multi-area spiking network model of cortex, using macaque visual cortex as a test system. The model represents each area by a microcircuit with area-specific architecture and features layer- and population-resolved connectivity between areas. Simulations reveal a structured asynchronous irregular ground state. In a metastable regime, the network reproduces spiking statistics from electrophysiological recordings and cortico-cortical interaction patterns in fMRI functional connectivity under resting-state conditions. Stable inter-area propagation is supported by cortico-cortical synapses that are moderately strong onto excitatory neurons and stronger onto inhibitory neurons. Causal interactions depend on both cortical structure and the dynamical state of populations. Activity propagates mainly in the feedback direction, similar to experimental results associated with visual imagery and sleep. The model unifies local and large-scale accounts of cortex, and clarifies how the detailed connectivity of cortex shapes its dynamics on multiple scales. Based on our simulations, we hypothesize that in the spontaneous condition the brain operates in a metastable regime where cortico-cortical projections target excitatory and inhibitory populations in a balanced manner that produces substantial inter-area interactions while maintaining global stability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0swIe6iJ5Ls&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: What, if anything, is rodent prefrontal cortex?</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Prefrontal cortex (PFC) means different things to different people. In recent years, there has been a major increase in publications on the PFC, especially using mice. However, inconsistencies in the nomenclature and anatomical boundaries of PFC areas has made it difficult for researchers to compare data and interpret findings across species. We conducted a meta-analysis of publications on the PFC of humans and rodents and found dramatic differences in the focus of research on these species. In addition, we compared anatomical terms and criteria across several common rodent brain atlases and found inconsistencies among, and even within, leading atlases. To assess the impact of these issues on the research community, we conducted a survey of established PFC researchers on their use of anatomical terms and found little consensus. We report on the results of the survey and propose an alternative scheme for interpreting data from rodent studies, based on structural analysis of the corpus callosum and nomenclature used in research on the anterior cingulate cortex of primates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Studies on prefrontal parts of the rodent cerebral cortex have appeared at an increasing rate in recent years. However, there has been no consensus on the terms used to describe the rodent prefrontal cortex (PFC) or how it relates to the PFC of monkeys and humans. To address these issues, we carried out a meta-analysis of publications on the PFC across species, a review of rodent brain atlases, a survey of PFC researchers on anatomical terms, and an analysis of how species differences in the corpus callosum might help relate PFC areas across species. Addressing these issues may help improve the clarity, rigor, and reproducibility of research on the rodent PFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07623</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In large neuronal networks, it is believed that functions emerge through the
collective behavior of many interconnected neurons. Recently, the development
of experimental techniques that allow simultaneous recording of calcium
concentration from a large fraction of all neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans -
a nematode with 302 neurons - creates the opportunity to ask if such emergence
is universal, reaching down to even the smallest brains. Here, we measure the
activity of 50+ neurons in C. elegans, and analyze the data by building the
maximum entropy model that matches the mean activity and pairwise correlations
among these neurons. To capture the graded nature of the cells' responses, we
assign each cell multiple states. These models, which are equivalent to a
family of Potts glasses, successfully predict higher statistical structure in
the network. In addition, these models exhibit signatures of collective
behavior: the state of single cells can be predicted from the state of the rest
of the network; the network, despite being sparse in a way similar to the
structural connectome, distributes its response globally when locally
perturbed; the distribution over network states has multiple local maxima, as
in models for memory; and the parameters that describe the real network are
close to a critical surface in this family of models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;About a decade ago grid cells were discovered in the medial entorhinal cortex
of rat. Their peculiar firing patterns, which correlate with periodic locations
in the environment, led to early hypothesis that grid cells may provide some
form of metric for space. Subsequent research has since uncovered a wealth of
new insights into the characteristics of grid cells and their neural
neighborhood, the parahippocampal-hippocampal region, calling for a revision
and refinement of earlier grid cell models. This survey paper aims to provide a
comprehensive summary of grid cell research published in the past decade. It
focuses on the functional characteristics of grid cells such as the influence
of external cues or the alignment to environmental geometry, but also provides
a basic overview of the underlying neural substrate.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Ensemble Inhibition and Excitation in the Human Cortex: an Ising Model Analysis with Uncertainties. (arXiv:1810.07253v1 [cond-mat.dis-nn])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07253</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07253</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The pairwise maximum entropy model, also known as the Ising model, has been
widely used to analyze the collective activity of neurons. However, controversy
persists in the literature about seemingly inconsistent findings, whose
significance is unclear due to lack of reliable error estimates. We therefore
develop a method for accurately estimating parameter uncertainty based on
random walks in parameter space using adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo after
the convergence of the main optimization algorithm. We apply our method to the
spiking patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neurons recorded with
multielectrode arrays in the human temporal cortex during the wake-sleep cycle.
Our analysis shows that the Ising model captures neuronal collective behavior
much better than the independent model during wakefulness, light sleep, and
deep sleep when both excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons are modeled;
ignoring the inhibitory effects of I-neurons dramatically overestimates
synchrony among E-neurons. Furthermore, information-theoretic measures reveal
that the Ising model explains about 80%-95% of the correlations, depending on
sleep state and neuron type. Thermodynamic measures show signatures of
criticality, although we take this with a grain of salt as it may be merely a
reflection of long-range neural correlations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Strategic heuristics underlie animal dominance hierarchies and provide evidence of group-level social knowledge. (arXiv:1810.07215v1 [q-bio.PE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07215</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07215</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The question of what animals understand about their social worlds is
fundamental to studies of the evolution of sociality, cognition, and animal
culture. However, the presence and extent of social knowledge in individuals is
difficult to detect, and when detections have been made, differences in
methodology make cross-species comparisons difficult. We present a new method
for detecting social knowledge. This method infers individual-level strategic
rules for aggression in dominance hierarchies where rank differences between
individuals may structure decision-making. We apply this method to a data from
172 social groups across 85 species in 22 orders. By looking for heuristics
that depend upon knowledge of group-level facts, we can back-infer the types of
knowledge individuals possess. Summary measures then place groups within a
taxonomy, providing a &quot;social assay&quot; of group-level knowledge. This assay
allows the identification of consensus strategies at the group level. The
majority of animal groups in our dataset (112 groups, 65%) follow a downward
heuristic, spreading aggression relatively equally across lower-ranked
opponents. An additional 50 groups (29%) use strategies that are indicative of
more detailed rank knowledge. Different groups within the same species can use
different strategies, indicating that the choice of heuristics may be
contextual and that the structuring of aggression should not be considered a
fixed characteristic of a species. Instead, individuals may be able to
plastically respond to changes in environmental or social conditions by
changing their strategies. Our approach to studying animal conflict provides
new opportunities to investigate the extent of rank knowledge across species,
compare the evolution of social knowledge, and better understand the effect of
social knowledge on individual behaviour in within-group conflict.

	<description>Human excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) take up the neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain and are essential to maintain excitatory neurotransmission. Our understanding of the EAATs' molecular mechanisms has been hampered by the lack of stability of purified protein samples for biophysical analyses. Here, we present approaches based on consensus mutagenesis to obtain thermostable EAAT1 variants that share up to ~ 95% amino acid identity with the wild type transporters, and remain natively folded and functional. Structural analyses of EAAT1 and the consensus designs using hydrogen-deuterium exchange linked to mass spectrometry show that small and highly cooperative unfolding events at the inter-subunit interface rate-limit their thermal denaturation, while the transport domain unfolds at a later stage in the unfolding pathway. Our findings provide structural insights into the kinetic stability of human glutamate transporters, and introduce general approaches to extend the lifetime of human membrane proteins for biophysical analyses.</description>

	<description>Replicative aging of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; is an established model system for eukaryotic cellular aging. A limitation in yeast lifespan studies has been the difficulty of separating old cells from young cells in large quantities. We engineered a new platform, the Miniature-chemostat Aging Device (MAD), that enables purification of aged cells at sufficient quantities for genomic and biochemical characterization of aging yeast populations. Using MAD, we measured DNA accessibility and gene expression changes in aging cells. Our data highlight an intimate connection between aging, growth rate, and stress. Stress-independent genes that change with age are highly enriched for targets of the signal recognition particle (SRP). Combining MAD with an improved ATAC-Seq method, we find that increasing proteasome activity reduces rDNA instability usually observed in aging cells, and contrary to published findings, provide evidence that global nucleosome occupancy does not change significantly with age.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The role of APETALA1 in petal number robustness</title>

	<description>Invariant floral forms are important for reproductive success and robust to natural perturbations. Petal number, for example, is invariant in&lt;i&gt; Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; thaliana &lt;/i&gt;flowers. However, petal number varies in the closely related species &lt;i&gt;Cardamine hirsuta&lt;/i&gt;, and the genetic basis for this difference between species is unknown. Here we show that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator &lt;i&gt;APETALA1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;AP1&lt;/i&gt;) can account for the species-specific difference in petal number robustness. This large effect of &lt;i&gt;AP1 &lt;/i&gt;is explained by epistatic interactions: &lt;i&gt;A. thaliana AP1&lt;/i&gt; confers robustness by masking the phenotypic expression of quantitative trait loci controlling petal number in &lt;i&gt;C. hirsuta&lt;/i&gt;. We show that &lt;i&gt;C. hirsuta AP1 &lt;/i&gt;fails to complement this function of &lt;i&gt;A. thaliana AP1&lt;/i&gt;, conferring variable petal number, and that upstream regulatory regions of &lt;i&gt;AP1 &lt;/i&gt;contribute to this divergence. Moreover, variable petal number is maintained in &lt;i&gt;C. hirsuta&lt;/i&gt; despite sufficient standing genetic variation in natural accessions to produce plants with four-petalled flowers.</description>

	<description>Dengue fever is caused by four different serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) which is the leading cause of worldwide arboviral diseases in humans. Virus-like particles (VLPs) containing flavivirus prM/E proteins have been demonstrated to be a potential vaccine candidate; however, the structure of dengue VLP is poorly understood. Herein VLP derived from DENV serotype-2 were engineered becoming highly matured (mD2VLP) and showed variable size distribution with diameter of ~31nm forming the major population under cryo-electron microscopy examination. Furthermore, mD2VLP particles of 31nm diameter possess a T=1 icosahedral symmetry with a groove located within the E-protein dimers near the 2-fold vertices that exposed highly overlapping, cryptic neutralizing epitopes. Mice vaccinated with mD2VLP generated higher cross-reactive (CR) neutralization antibodies (NtAbs) and were fully protected against all 4 serotypes of DENV. Our results highlight the potential of 'epitope-resurfaced' mature-form D2VLPs in inducing quaternary structure-recognizing broad CR NtAbs to guide future dengue vaccine design.</description>

	<description>Storing temporal sequences of events (i.e., sequence memory) is fundamental to many cognitive functions. However, how the sequence order information is maintained and represented in working memory and its behavioral significance, particularly in human subjects, remains unknown. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in combination with a temporal response function (TRF) method to dissociate item-specific neuronal reactivations. We demonstrate that serially remembered items are successively reactivated during memory retention. The sequential replay displays two interesting properties compared to the actual sequence. First, the item-by-item reactivation is compressed within a 200-400 ms window, suggesting that external events are associated within a plasticity-relevant window to facilitate memory consolidation. Second, the replay is in a temporally reversed order and is strongly related to the recency effect in behavior. This fast-backward replay, previously revealed in rat hippocampus and demonstrated here in human cortical activities, might constitute a general neural mechanism for sequence memory and learning.</description>

	<description>Aging-related cognitive decline represents a critical risk factor for the development of dementia and is associated with global neurophysiological changes. It is imperative to act early, while the neural reserve is still sufficient, to prevent or postpone cognitive decline. Given that no significant modifying pharmacological intervention is available, a focus on pharmacological agents alone seems insufficient. We argue that combinations of different approaches are most effective in stimulating long-lasting molecular changes that restore, promote, and preserve cognition through the modulation of cognitively relevant neurotransmitter systems that ultimately converge in driving neurotrophic signaling.</description>

The relationship between brain structure and function has been probed using a variety of approaches, but how the underlying structural connectivity of the human brain drives behavior is far from understood. To investigate the effect of anatomical brain organization on human task performance, we use a data-driven computational modeling approach and explore the functional effects of naturally occurring structural differences in brain networks. We construct personalized brain network models by combining anatomical connectivity estimated from diffusion spectrum imaging of individual subjects with a nonlinear model of brain dynamics. By performing computational experiments in which we measure the excitability of the global brain network and spread of synchronization following a targeted computational stimulation, we quantify how individual variation in the underlying connectivity impacts both local and global brain dynamics. We further relate the computational results to individual variability in the subjects’ performance of three language-demanding tasks both before and after transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left-inferior frontal gyrus. Our results show that task performance correlates with either local or global measures of functional activity, depending on the complexity of the task. By emphasizing differences in the underlying structural connectivity, our model serves as a powerful tool to assess individual differences in task performances, to dissociate the effect of targeted stimulation in tasks that differ in cognitive demand, and to pave the way for the development of personalized therapeutics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zw5QfjF3eog&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Genomic data integration systematically biases interactome mapping</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael A. Skinnider, R. Greg Stacey, Leonard J. Foster&lt;/p&gt;

Elucidating the complete network of protein-protein interactions, or interactome, is a fundamental goal of the post-genomic era, yet existing interactome maps are far from complete. To increase the throughput and resolution of interactome mapping, methods for protein-protein interaction discovery by co-migration have been introduced. However, accurate identification of interacting protein pairs within the resulting large-scale proteomic datasets is challenging. Consequently, most computational pipelines for co-migration data analysis incorporate external genomic datasets to distinguish interacting from non-interacting protein pairs. The effect of this procedure on interactome mapping is poorly understood. Here, we conduct a rigorous analysis of genomic data integration for interactome recovery across a large number of co-migration datasets, spanning diverse experimental and computational methods. We find that genomic data integration leads to an increase in the functional coherence of the resulting interactome maps, but this comes at the expense of a decrease in power to discover novel interactions. Importantly, putative novel interactions predicted by genomic data integration are no more likely to later be experimentally discovered than those predicted from co-migration data alone. Our results reveal a widespread and unappreciated limitation in a methodology that has been widely used to map the interactome of humans and model organisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FgE0UzOuvEs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting B cell receptor substitution profiles using public repertoire data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006388</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Amrit Dhar, Kristian Davidsen, Frederick A. Matsen IV, Vladimir N. Minin&lt;/p&gt;

B cells develop high affinity receptors during the course of affinity maturation, a cyclic process of mutation and selection. At the end of affinity maturation, a number of cells sharing the same ancestor (i.e. in the same “clonal family”) are released from the germinal center; their amino acid frequency profile reflects the allowed and disallowed substitutions at each position. These clonal-family-specific frequency profiles, called “substitution profiles”, are useful for studying the course of affinity maturation as well as for antibody engineering purposes. However, most often only a single sequence is recovered from each clonal family in a sequencing experiment, making it impossible to construct a clonal-family-specific substitution profile. Given the public release of many high-quality large B cell receptor datasets, one may ask whether it is possible to use such data in a prediction model for clonal-family-specific substitution profiles. In this paper, we present the method “Substitution Profiles Using Related Families” (SPURF), a penalized tensor regression framework that integrates information from a rich assemblage of datasets to predict the clonal-family-specific substitution profile for any single input sequence. Using this framework, we show that substitution profiles from similar clonal families can be leveraged together with simulated substitution profiles and germline gene sequence information to improve prediction. We fit this model on a large public dataset and validate the robustness of our approach on two external datasets. Furthermore, we provide a command-line tool in an open-source software package (https://github.com/krdav/SPURF) implementing these ideas and providing easy prediction using our pre-fit models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JsZ93r65PGI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: DMRT5, DMRT3, and EMX2 Cooperatively Repress Gsx2 at the Pallium-Subpallium Boundary to Maintain Cortical Identity in Dorsal Telencephalic Progenitors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Specification of dorsoventral regional identity in progenitors of the developing telencephalon is a first pivotal step in the development of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. Previously, we demonstrated that the two zinc finger &lt;i&gt;doublesex&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mab-3 related&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Dmrt&lt;/i&gt;) genes, &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Dmrta2&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Dmrt3&lt;/i&gt;, which are coexpressed in high caudomedial to low rostrolateral gradients in the cerebral cortical primordium, are separately needed for normal formation of the cortical hem, hippocampus, and caudomedial neocortex. We have now addressed the role of &lt;i&gt;Dmrt3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; in controlling dorsoventral division of the telencephalon in mice of either sex by comparing the phenotypes of single knock-out (KO) with double KO embryos and by misexpressing &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; in the ventral telencephalon. We find that DMRT3 and DMRT5 act as critical regulators of progenitor cell dorsoventral identity by repressing ventralizing regulators. Early ventral fate transcriptional regulators expressed in the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence, such as &lt;i&gt;Gsx2&lt;/i&gt;, are upregulated in the dorsal telencephalon of &lt;i&gt;Dmrt3;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; double KO embryos and downregulated when ventral telencephalic progenitors express ectopic &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt;. Conditional overexpression of &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; throughout the telencephalon produces gene expression and structural defects that are highly consistent with reduced GSX2 activity. Further, &lt;i&gt;Emx2;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; double KO embryos show a phenotype similar to &lt;i&gt;Dmrt3;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; double KO embryos, and both DMRT3, DMRT5 and the homeobox transcription factor EMX2 bind to a ventral telencephalon-specific enhancer in the &lt;i&gt;Gsx2&lt;/i&gt; locus. Together, our findings uncover cooperative functions of DMRT3, DMRT5, and EMX2 in dividing dorsal from ventral in the telencephalon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We identified the DMRT3 and DMRT5 zinc finger transcription factors as novel regulators of dorsoventral patterning in the telencephalon. Our data indicate that they have overlapping functions and compensate for one another. The double, but not the single, knock-out produces a dorsal telencephalon that is ventralized, and olfactory bulb tissue takes over most remaining cortex. Conversely, overexpressing &lt;i&gt;Dmrt5&lt;/i&gt; throughout the telencephalon causes expanded expression of dorsal gene determinants and smaller olfactory bulbs. Furthermore, we show that the homeobox transcription factor EMX2 that is coexpressed with DMRT3 and DMRT5 in cortical progenitors cooperates with them to maintain dorsoventral patterning in the telencephalon. Our study suggests that DMRT3/5 function with EMX2 in positioning the pallial-subpallial boundary by antagonizing the ventral homeobox transcription factor GSX2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hippocampal-Evoked Feedforward Inhibition in the Nucleus Accumbens</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9091?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is critical for motivated behavior and is rewired following exposure to drugs of abuse. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc express either D1 or D2 receptors and project to distinct downstream targets. Differential activation of these MSNs depends on both excitation from long-range inputs and inhibition via the local circuit. Assessing how long-range excitatory inputs engage inhibitory circuitry is therefore important for understanding NAc function. Here, we use slice electrophysiology and optogenetics to study ventral hippocampal (vHPC)-evoked feedforward inhibition in the NAc of male and female mice. We find that vHPC-evoked excitation is stronger at D1+ than D1– MSNs, whereas inhibition is unbiased at the two cell types. vHPC inputs contact both parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons, but PV+ cells are preferentially activated. Moreover, suppressing PV+ interneurons indicates they are primarily responsible for vHPC-evoked inhibition. Finally, repeated cocaine exposure alters the excitation of D1+ and D1– MSNs, without concomitant changes to inhibition, shifting the excitation/inhibition balance. Together, our results highlight the contributions of multiple interneuron populations to feedforward inhibition in the NAc. Moreover, they demonstrate that inhibition provides a stable backdrop on which drug-evoked changes to excitation occur within this circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Given the importance of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in reward learning and drug-seeking behaviors, it is critical to understand what controls the activity of cells in this region. While excitatory inputs to projection neurons in the NAc have been identified, it is unclear how the local inhibitory network becomes engaged. Here, we identify a sparse population of interneurons responsible for feedforward inhibition evoked by ventral hippocampal input and characterize their connections within the NAc. We also demonstrate that the balance of excitation and inhibition that projection neurons experience is altered by exposure to cocaine. Together, this work provides insight into the fundamental circuitry of this region as well as the effects of drugs of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hypothalamic CCL2/CCR2 Chemokine System: Role in Sexually Dimorphic Effects of Maternal Ethanol Exposure on Melanin-Concentrating Hormone and Behavior in Adolescent Offspring</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9072?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Clinical and animal studies show that ethanol exposure and inflammation during pregnancy cause similar behavioral disturbances in the offspring. While ethanol is shown to stimulate both neuroimmune and neurochemical systems in adults, little is known about their anatomical relationship in response to ethanol &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; and whether neuroimmune factors mediate ethanol's effects on neuronal development and behavior in offspring. Here we examined in female and male adolescent rats a specific population of neurons concentrated in lateral hypothalamus, which coexpress the inflammatory chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) or its receptor CCR2 with the orexigenic neuropeptide, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), that promotes ethanol drinking behavior. We demonstrate that maternal administration of ethanol (2 g/kg/d) from embryonic day 10 (E10) to E15, while having little impact on glia, stimulates expression of neuronal CCL2 and CCR2, increases density of both large CCL2 neurons colocalizing MCH and small CCL2 neurons surrounding MCH neurons, and stimulates ethanol drinking and anxiety in adolescent offspring. We show that these neuronal and behavioral changes are similarly produced by maternal administration of CCL2 (4 or 8 μg/kg/d, E10–E15) and blocked by maternal administration of a CCR2 antagonist INCB3344 (1 mg/kg/d, E10–E15), and these effects of ethanol and CCL2 are sexually dimorphic, consistently stronger in females. These results suggest that this neuronal CCL2/CCR2 system closely linked to MCH neurons has a role in mediating the effects of maternal ethanol exposure on adolescent offspring and contributes to the higher levels of adolescent risk factors for alcohol use disorders described in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ethanol consumption and inflammatory agents during pregnancy similarly increase alcohol intake and anxiety in adolescent offspring. To investigate how neurochemical and neuroimmune systems interact to mediate these disturbances, we examined a specific population of hypothalamic neurons coexpressing the inflammatory chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 with the neuropeptide, melanin-concentrating hormone. We demonstrate in adolescent offspring that maternal administration of CCL2, like ethanol, stimulates these neurons and increases ethanol drinking and anxiety, and these effects of ethanol are blocked by maternal CCR2 antagonist and consistently stronger in females. This suggests that neuronal chemokine signaling linked to neuropeptides mediates effects of maternal ethanol exposure on adolescent offspring and contributes to higher levels of adolescent risk factors for alcohol use disorders in women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Control of Sleep Onset by Shal/Kv4 Channels in Drosophila Circadian Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep is highly conserved across animal species. Both wake- and sleep-promoting neurons are implicated in the regulation of wake–sleep transition at dusk in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. However, little is known about how they cooperate and whether they act via different mechanisms. Here, we demonstrated that in female &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, sleep onset was specifically delayed by blocking the Shaker cognate L channels [Shal; also known as voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel 4 (K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4)] in wake-promoting cells, including large ventral lateral neurons (l-LNvs) and pars intercerebralis (PI), but not in sleep-promoting dorsal neurons (DN1s). Delayed sleep onset was also observed in males by blocking K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 activity in wake-promoting neurons. Electrophysiological recordings show that K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 channels contribute A-type currents in LNvs and PI cells, but are much less conspicuous in DN1s. Interestingly, blocking K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 in wake-promoting neurons preferentially increased firing rates at dusk ~ZT13, when the resting membrane potentials and firing rates were at lower levels. Furthermore, pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is essential for the regulation of sleep onset by K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 in l-LNvs, and downregulation of PDF receptor (PDFR) in PI neurons advanced sleep onset, indicating K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 controls sleep onset via regulating PDF/PDFR signaling in wake-promoting neurons. We propose that K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 acts as a sleep onset controller by suppressing membrane excitability in a clock-dependent manner to balance the wake–sleep transition at dusk. Our results have important implications for the understanding and treatment of sleep disorders such as insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanisms by which our brains reversibly switch from waking to sleep state remain an unanswered and intriguing question in biological research. In this study, we identified that Shal/K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4, a well known voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel, acts as a controller of wake–sleep transition at dusk in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; circadian neurons. We find that interference of K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 function with a dominant-negative form (DNK&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4) in subsets of circadian neurons specifically disrupts sleep onset at dusk, although K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 itself does not exhibit circadian oscillation. K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;4 preferentially downregulates neuronal firings at ZT9–ZT17, supporting that it plays an essential role in wake–sleep transition at dusk. Our findings may help understand and eventually treat sleep disorders such as insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Opioid-Independent and Opioid-Mediated Modes of Pain Modulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9047?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9047?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pain is regulated endogenously through both opioid and non-opioid mechanisms. We hypothesized that two novel pain modulation tasks, one drawing on context/expectations and one using voluntary reappraisal, would show differing levels of opioid dependence. Specifically, we expected that naloxone would block context-related analgesia, whereas mental imagery-based pain reappraisal would be opioid-independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A double-blind, placebo-controlled intravenous naloxone versus saline crossover design was used. Twenty healthy volunteers completed the two modulation tasks with acute heat stimuli calibrated to induce moderate pain. In the mental imagery task, participants imagined either a &quot;pleasant&quot; or a &quot;comparison&quot; scenario during painful heat. In the relative relief task, moderate heat stimuli coincided with visual cues eliciting relief from the expectation of intense pain, and were compared with moderate heat stimuli delivered under the expectation of non-painful warmth. Both &quot;pleasant imagery&quot; and &quot;relative relief&quot; conditions significantly improved ratings of pain intensity and pleasantness during saline treatment. Indeed, the target stimuli in both tasks, which had been calibrated to induce moderate pain, were rated as mildly pleasant. Furthermore, consistently with the main hypothesis, blocking endogenous opioid signaling with naloxone did not significantly affect imagery-induced regulation of pain intensity or pleasantness. In contrast, the relative relief-induced pain regulation (i.e., context/expectation) was blocked by naloxone. We conclude that endogenous opioid signaling is necessary for expectation-related relative relief analgesia, but not for pain reappraisal through mental imagery. These results support mental imagery as a powerful and clinically relevant strategy for regulating pain affect also in patients where endogenous opioid mechanisms might be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurotransmitter systems in the human brain can be probed through antagonist drugs. Studies using the opioid antagonist naloxone have demonstrated that the brain relies on both opioid and non-opioid mechanisms to downregulate pain. This holds clinical relevance given altered endogenous opioid processes in many chronic pain conditions. The present study used a double-blinded, placebo-controlled naloxone blockage of endogenous opioids in healthy humans to show differential opioid involvement in two pain modulation tasks. Context/expectation-driven (relative relief-related) analgesia was blocked by naloxone. In contrast, pain reappraisal through mental imagery was intact despite opioid receptor blockade, suggesting opioid independence. These results support mental imagery as a powerful, clinically relevant strategy for regulating pain as it does not rely on a functioning opioidergic system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Early Appearance and Spread of Fast Ripples in the Hippocampus in a Model of Cortical Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fast ripples (FRs; activity of &amp;gt;250 Hz) have been considered as a biomarker of epileptic activity in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex; it is thought that they signal the focus of seizure generation. Similar high-frequency network activity has been produced &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; by changing extracellular medium composition, by using pro-epileptic substances, or by electrical stimulation. Here we study the propagation of these events between different subregions of the male rat hippocampus in a recently introduced experimental model of FRs in entorhinal cortex–hippocampal slices &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. By using a matrix of 4096 microelectrodes, the sites of initiation, propagation pathways, and spatiotemporal characteristics of activity patterns could be studied with unprecedented high resolution. To this end, we developed an analytic tool based on bidimensional current source density estimation, which delimits sinks and sources with a high precision and evaluates their trajectories using the concept of center of mass. With this methodology, we found that FRs can arise almost simultaneously at noncontiguous sites in the CA3-to-CA1 direction, underlying the spatial heterogeneity of epileptogenic foci, while continuous somatodendritic waves of activity develop. An unexpected, yet important propagation route is the propagation of activity from CA3 into the hilus and dentate gyrus. This pathway may cause reverberating activation of both regions, supporting sustained pathological network events and altered information processing in hippocampal networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fast ripples (FRs) have been considered as a biomarker of epileptic activity and may signal the focus of seizure generation. In a model of traumatic brain injury in the rat, FRs appear in the hippocampus within a couple of hours after an extrahippocampal, cortical lesion. We analyzed the origin and dynamics of the FRs in the hippocampus using massive electrophysiological recordings, allowing an unprecedented high spatiotemporal resolution. We show that FRs originate in distinct and noncontiguous locations within the CA3 region and uncover, with high precision, the extent and dynamics of their current density. This activity propagates toward CA1 but also backpropagates to the hilus and the dentate gyrus, suggesting activation of defined microcircuits that can sustain recurrent excitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reduced Microglial Activity and Enhanced Glutamate Transmission in the Basolateral Amygdala in Early CNS Autoimmunity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emotional dysfunction is common in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and in mouse models of MS, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); however, the etiology of these behaviors is poorly understood. To identify CNS changes associated with these behaviors, we focused on the basolateral amygdala (BLA) because of its central role in the regulation of emotional behavior. Whole-cell recordings were performed in the principal neurons of the BLA in early EAE, before demyelination, T-cell invasion, and motor dysfunction. EAE female mice displayed increased frequency of mEPSCs, with no alteration in amplitude or evoked EPSC paired-pulse ratio compared with controls. We found an increase in the AMPA-NMDA ratio and dendritic spine density, indicating increased numbers of glutamatergic synapses. We saw similar electrophysiological changes in BLA principal neurons after microglia were either inactivated (minocycline) or depleted (Mac1-Saporin) in the BLA. Microglia regulate synapses through pruning, directed by complement protein 3 (C3) expression. C3 was downregulated in the BLA in EAE. Ultrastructural analysis of microglia revealed more complex ramifications and reduced extracellular digestion of cellular elements. We also observed reduced IBA-1 and CD68 staining and lack of proinflammatory cytokine expression in the amygdala. Thus, early EAE is a state of microglial &quot;deactivation&quot; associated with reduced synaptic pruning. This contrasts with the prototypic microglial activation commonly associated with inflammatory CNS disease. Additionally, these data support a role for the acquired immune system to influence both neuronal and microglial function in early CNS autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Microglia help regulate synaptic homeostasis, but there has been little evidence for how this might be important in neuroinflammatory diseases. The data from this study reveal increased synaptic activity and spine density in early stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (an animal model of multiple sclerosis) in the basolateral amygdala, a nucleus important in the types of behavioral changes we have previously described. These electrophysiological and morphological effects occurred without significant elevation of local inflammatory cytokines or local demyelination. Unexpectedly, in the context of inflammatory state, we found that microglia were &quot;deactivated.&quot; This study provides strong evidence for a link between microglial activity and synaptic function; the conclusions contrast with the generally accepted view that microglia are activated in inflammatory disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: TOM1 Regulates Neuronal Accumulation of Amyloid-{beta} Oligomers by Fc{gamma}RIIb2 Variant in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9001?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidences suggest that intraneuronal Aβ correlates with the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and highly contributes to neurodegeneration. However, critical mediator responsible for Aβ uptake in AD pathology needs to be clarified. Here, we report that FcRIIb2, a variant of Fc-receptor IIb (FcRIIb), functions in neuronal uptake of pathogenic Aβ. Cellular accumulation of oligomeric Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42,&lt;/sub&gt; not monomeric Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; or oligomeric Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt;, was blocked by &lt;i&gt;Fcgr2b&lt;/i&gt; knock-out in neurons and partially in astrocytes. Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; internalization was FcRIIb2 di-leucine motif-dependent and attenuated by TOM1, a FcRIIb2-binding protein that repressed the receptor recycling. TOM1 expression was downregulated in the hippocampus of male 3xTg-AD mice and AD patients, and regulated by miR-126-3p in neuronal cells after exposure to Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition, memory impairments in male 3xTg-AD mice were rescued by the lentiviral administration of TOM1 gene. Augmented Aβ uptake into lysosome caused its accumulation in cytoplasm and mitochondria. Moreover, neuronal accumulation of Aβ in both sexes of 3xTg-AD mice and memory deficits in male 3xTg-AD mice were ameliorated by forebrain-specific expression of Aβ-uptake-defective &lt;i&gt;Fcgr2b&lt;/i&gt; mutant. Our findings suggest that FcRIIb2 is essential for neuropathic uptake of Aβ in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Accumulating evidences suggest that intraneuronal Aβ is found in the early step of AD brain and is implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. However, the critical mediator involved in these processes is uncertain. Here, we describe that the FcRIIb2 variant is responsible for both neuronal uptake and intraneuronal distribution of pathogenic Aβ linked to memory deficits in AD mice, showing a pathologic significance of the internalized Aβ. Further, Aβ internalization is attenuated by TOM1, a novel FcRIIb2-binding protein. Together, we provide a molecular mechanism responsible for neuronal uptake of pathogenic Aβ found in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep Strengthens Predictive Sequence Coding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/8989?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/8989?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predictive-coding theories assume that perception and action are based on internal models derived from previous experience. Such internal models require selection and consolidation to be stored over time. Sleep is known to support memory consolidation. We hypothesized that sleep supports both consolidation and abstraction of an internal task model that is subsequently used to predict upcoming stimuli. Human subjects (of either sex) were trained on deterministic visual sequences and tested with interleaved deviant stimuli after retention intervals of sleep or wakefulness. Adopting a predictive-coding approach, we found increased prediction strength after sleep, as expressed by increased error rates to deviant stimuli, but fewer errors for the immediately following standard stimuli. Sleep likewise enhanced the formation of an abstract sequence model, independent of the temporal context during training. Moreover, sleep increased confidence for sequence knowledge, reflecting enhanced metacognitive access to the model. Our results suggest that sleep supports the formation of internal models which can be used to predict upcoming events in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To efficiently interact with the ever-changing world, we predict upcoming events based on similar previous experiences. Sleep is known to benefit memory consolidation. However, it is not clear whether sleep specifically supports the transformation of past experience into predictions of future events. Here, we find that, when human subjects sleep after learning a sequence of predictable visual events, they make better predictions about upcoming events compared with subjects who stayed awake for an equivalent period of time. In addition, sleep supports the transfer of such knowledge between different temporal contexts (i.e., when sequences unfold at different speeds). Thus, sleep supports perception and action by enhancing the predictive utility of previous experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Graded Transmission without Action Potentials Sustains Rhythmic Activity in Some But Not All Modulators That Activate the Same Current</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/8976?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the central pattern-generating circuits in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) release neurotransmitter both as a graded function of presynaptic membrane potential that persists in TTX and in response to action potentials. In the STG of the male crab &lt;i&gt;Cancer borealis&lt;/i&gt;, the modulators oxotremorine, &lt;i&gt;C. borealis&lt;/i&gt; tachykinin-related peptide Ia (CabTRP1a), red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH), proctolin, TNRNFLRFamide, and crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) produce and sustain robust pyloric rhythms by activating the same modulatory current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;MI&lt;/sub&gt;), albeit on different subsets of pyloric network targets. The muscarinic agonist oxotremorine, and the peptides CabTRP1a and RPCH elicited rhythmic triphasic intracellular alternating fluctuations of activity in the presence of TTX. Intracellular waveforms of pyloric neurons in oxotremorine and CabTRP1a in TTX were similar to those in the intact rhythm, and phase relationships among neurons were conserved. Although cycle frequency was conserved in oxotremorine and TTX, it was altered in CabTRP1a in the presence of TTX. Both rhythms were primarily driven by the pacemaker kernel consisting of the Anterior Burster and Pyloric Dilator neurons. In contrast, in TTX the circuit remained silent in proctolin, TNRNFLRFamide, and CCAP. These experiments show that graded synaptic transmission in the absence of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current is sufficient to sustain rhythmic motor activity in some, but not other, modulatory conditions, even when each modulator activates the same ionic current. This further demonstrates that similar rhythmic motor patterns can be produced by qualitatively different mechanisms, one that depends on the activity of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, and one that can persist in their absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The pyloric rhythm of the crab stomatogastric ganglion depends both on spike-mediated and graded synaptic transmission. We activate the pyloric rhythm with a wide variety of different neuromodulators, all of which converge on the same voltage-dependent inward current. Interestingly, when action potentials and spike-mediated transmission are blocked using TTX, we find that the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine and the neuropeptide CabTRP1a sustain rhythmic alternations and appropriate phases of activity in the absence of action potentials. In contrast, TTX blocks rhythmic activity in the presence of other modulators. This demonstrates fundamental differences in the burst-generation mechanisms in different modulators that would not be suspected on the basis of their cellular actions at the level of the targeted current.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Correlate of Visual Familiarity in Macaque Area V2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/8967?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/8967?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in macaque inferotemporal cortex (ITC) respond less strongly to familiar than to novel images. It is commonly assumed that this effect arises within ITC because its neurons respond selectively to complex images and thus encode in an explicit form information sufficient for identifying a particular image as familiar. However, no prior study has examined whether neurons in low-order visual areas selective for local features also exhibit familiarity suppression. To address this issue, we recorded from neurons in macaque area V2 with semichronic microelectrode arrays while monkeys repeatedly viewed a set of large complex natural images. We report here that V2 neurons exhibit familiarity suppression. The effect develops over several days with a trajectory well fitted by an exponential function with a rate constant of ~100 exposures. Suppression occurs in V2 at a latency following image onset shorter than its reported latency in ITC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Familiarity suppression, the tendency for neurons to respond less strongly to familiar than novel images, is well known in monkey inferotemporal cortex. Suppression has been thought to arise in inferotemporal cortex because its neurons respond selectively to large complex images and thus explicitly to encode information sufficient for identifying a particular image as familiar. No previous study has explored the possibility that familiarity suppression occurs even in early-stage visual areas where neurons are selective for simple features in confined receptive fields. We now report that neurons in area V2 exhibit familiarity suppression. This finding challenges our current understanding of information processing in V2 as well as our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie familiarity suppression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Divergent Prelimbic Cortical Pathways Interact with BDNF to Regulate Cocaine-seeking</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A single BDNF microinfusion into prelimbic (PrL) cortex immediately after the last cocaine self-administration session decreases relapse to cocaine-seeking. The BDNF effect is blocked by NMDAR antagonists. To determine whether synaptic activity in putative excitatory projection neurons in PrL cortex is sufficient for BDNF's effect on relapse, the PrL cortex of male rats was infused with an inhibitory Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) viral vector driven by an αCaMKII promoter. Immediately after the last cocaine self-administration session, rats were injected with clozapine-N-oxide 30 min before an intra-PrL BDNF microinfusion. DREADD-mediated inhibition of the PrL cortex blocked the BDNF-induced decrease in cocaine-seeking after abstinence and cue-induced reinstatement after extinction. Unexpectedly, DREADD inhibition of PrL neurons in PBS-infused rats also reduced cocaine-seeking, suggesting that divergent PrL pathways affect relapse. Next, using a cre-dependent retroviral approach, we tested the ability of DREADD inhibition of PrL projections to the NAc core or the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) to alter cocaine-seeking in BDNF- and PBS-infused rats. Selective inhibition of the PrL-NAc pathway at the end of cocaine self-administration blocked the BDNF-induced decrease in cocaine-seeking but had no effect in PBS-infused rats. In contrast, selective inhibition of the PrL-PVT pathway in PBS-infused rats decreased cocaine-seeking, and this effect was prevented in BDNF-infused rats. Thus, activity in the PrL-NAc pathway is responsible for the therapeutic effect of BDNF on cocaine-seeking whereas inhibition of activity in the PrL-pPVT pathway elicits a similar therapeutic effect in the absence of BDNF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The major issue in cocaine addiction is the high rate of relapse. However, the neuronal pathways governing relapse remain unclear. Using a pathway-specific chemogenetic approach, we found that BDNF differentially regulates two key prelimbic pathways to guide long-term relapse. Infusion of BDNF in the prelimbic cortex during early withdrawal from cocaine self-administration decreases relapse that is prevented when neurons projecting from the prelimbic cortex to the nucleus accumbens core are inhibited. In contrast, BDNF restores relapse when neurons projecting from the prelimbic cortex to the posterior paraventricular thalamic nucleus are inhibited. This study demonstrates that two divergent cortical outputs mediate relapse that is regulated in opposite directions by infusing BDNF in the prelimbic cortex during early withdrawal from cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The salience network is a distributed neural system that maintains homeostasis by regulating autonomic nervous system activity and social-emotional function. Here we examined how within-network connectivity relates to individual differences in human (including males and females) baseline parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous activity. We measured resting autonomic nervous system physiology in 24 healthy controls and 23 patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by baseline autonomic deficits. Participants also underwent structural and task-free fMRI. First, we used voxel-based morphometry to determine whether salience network atrophy was associated with lower baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (a parasympathetic measure) and skin conductance level (a sympathetic measure) in bvFTD. Next, we examined whether functional connectivity deficits in 21 autonomic-relevant, salience network node-pairs related to baseline autonomic dysfunction. Lower baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia was associated with smaller volume in left ventral anterior insula (vAI), weaker connectivity between bilateral vAI and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and stronger connectivity between bilateral ACC and bilateral hypothalamus/amygdala. Lower baseline skin conductance level, in contrast, was associated with smaller volume in inferior temporal gyrus, dorsal mid-insula, and hypothalamus; weaker connectivity between bilateral ACC and right hypothalamus/amygdala; and stronger connectivity between bilateral dorsal anterior insula and periaqueductal gray. Our results suggest that baseline parasympathetic and sympathetic tone depends on the integrity of lateralized salience network hubs (left vAI for parasympathetic and right hypothalamus/amygdala for sympathetic) and highly calibrated ipsilateral and contralateral network connections. In bvFTD, deficits in this system may underlie resting parasympathetic and sympathetic disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The salience network maintains homeostasis and regulates autonomic nervous system activity. Whether within-network connectivity patterns underlie individual differences in resting parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity, however, is not well understood. We measured baseline autonomic nervous system activity in healthy controls and patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by resting autonomic deficits, and probed how salience network dysfunction relates to diminished parasympathetic and sympathetic outflow. Our results indicate that baseline parasympathetic and sympathetic tone are the product of complex, opposing intranetwork nodal interactions and depend on the integrity of highly tuned, lateralized salience network hubs (i.e., left ventral anterior insula for parasympathetic activity and right hypothalamus/amygdala for sympathetic activity).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stress is a precipitating agent in neuropsychiatric disease and initiates relapse to drug-seeking behavior in addicted patients. Targeting the stress system in protracted abstinence from drugs of abuse with anxiolytics may be an effective treatment modality for substance use disorders. α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptors (α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-ARs) in extended amygdala structures play key roles in dampening stress responses. Contrary to early thinking, α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-ARs are expressed at non-noradrenergic sites in the brain. These non-noradrenergic α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-ARs play important roles in stress responses, but their cellular mechanisms of action are unclear. In humans, the α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR agonist guanfacine reduces overall craving and uncouples craving from stress, yet minimally affects relapse, potentially due to competing actions in the brain. Here, we show that heteroceptor α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-ARs postsynaptically enhance dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST) neuronal activity in mice of both sexes. This effect is mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels because inhibition of these channels is necessary and sufficient for excitatory actions. Finally, this excitatory action is mimicked by clozapine-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide activation of the G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled DREADD hM4Di in dBNST neurons and its activation elicits anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. Together, these data provide a framework for elucidating cell-specific actions of GPCR signaling and provide a potential mechanism whereby competing anxiogenic and anxiolytic actions of guanfacine may affect its clinical utility in the treatment of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stress affects the development of neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety and addiction. Guanfacine is an α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2A-AR) agonist with actions in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that produces antidepressant actions and uncouples stress from reward-related behaviors. Here, we show that guanfacine increases dorsal BNST neuronal activity through actions at postsynaptic α2A-ARs via a mechanism that involves hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated cation channels. This action is mimicked by activation of the designer receptor hM4Di expressed in the BNST, which also induces anxiety-like behaviors. Together, these data suggest that postsynaptic α2A-ARs in BNST have excitatory actions on BNST neurons and that these actions can be phenocopied by the so-called &quot;inhibitory&quot; DREADDs, suggesting that care must be taken regarding interpretation of data obtained with these tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Distal Dendritic Enrichment of HCN1 Channels in Hippocampal CA1 Is Promoted by Estrogen, but Does Not Require Reelin</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;HCN1 compartmentalization in CA1 pyramidal cells, essential for hippocampal information processing, is believed to be controlled by the extracellular matrix protein Reelin. Expression of Reelin, in turn, is stimulated by 17β-estradiol (E2). In this study, we therefore tested whether E2 regulates the compartmentalization of HCN1 in CA1 via Reelin. In organotypic entorhino-hippocampal cultures, we found that E2 promotes HCN1 distal dendritic enrichment via the G protein–coupled estrogen receptor GPER1, but apparently independent of Reelin, because GST-RAP, known to reduce Reelin signaling, did not prevent E2-induced HCN1 enrichment in distal CA1. We therefore re-examined the role of Reelin for the regulation of HCN1 compartmentalization and could not detect effects of reduced Reelin signaling on HCN1 distribution in CA1, either in the (developmental) slice culture model or in tamoxifen-inducible conditional &lt;i&gt;reelin&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice during adulthood. We conclude that for HCN1 channel compartmentalization in CA1 pyramidal cells, Reelin is not as essential as previously proposed, and E2 effects on HCN1 distribution in CA1 are mediated by mechanisms that do not involve Reelin. Because HCN1 localization was not altered at different phases of the estrous cycle, gonadally derived estradiol is unlikely to regulate HCN1 channel compartmentalization, while the pattern of immunoreactivity of aromatase, the final enzyme of estradiol synthesis, argues for a role of local hippocampal E2 synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Simultaneous Assessment of Homonymous and Heteronymous Monosynaptic Reflex Excitability in the Adult Rat</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In order to successfully perform motor tasks such as locomotion, the central nervous system must coordinate contractions of antagonistic and synergistic muscles across multiple joints. This coordination is largely dependent upon the function of proprioceptive afferents (PAs), which make monosynaptic connections with homonymous motoneurons. Homonymous pathways have been well studied in both health and disease but their collateral fibers projecting to heteronymous, synergistic muscles receive relatively less attention. This is surprising given that PA collaterals have significant effects on the excitability of heteronymous motoneurons, and that their synaptic terminal density is activity dependent. It is likely that the relative lack of literature is due to the lack of a preparation which allows synergistic heteronymous pathways to be assessed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we describe a method to simultaneously evoke homonymous and heteronymous (synergistic) monosynaptic reflexes (MSRs) and study their modulation by descending pathways in adult rats. Through stimulation of the medial plantar nerve, we were able to produce an H reflex in the intrinsic foot (IF) muscles of the hind paw with a latency of 10.52 ± 3.8 ms. Increasing the stimulus intensity evoked a robust signal with a monosynaptic latency (11.32 ± 0.35 ms), recorded in the ipsilateral gastrocnemius (Gs). Our subsequent analyses suggest that Gs motoneurons were activated via heteronymous afferent collaterals from the medial plantar nerve. These reflexes could be evoked bilaterally and were modulated by conditioning stimuli to the cortex (Cx) and reticular formation. Interestingly, cortical stimulation was equally efficient at modulating both ipsilateral and contralateral reflexes, indicating that cortical modulation of lumbar sensory afferents lacks the laterality demonstrated by studies of cortical muscle activation. This technique represents a novel, relatively simple way to assess heteronymous afferent pathways in normal motor control as well as in models of motor disorders where adaptive and maladaptive plasticity of PAs and descending systems affects functional outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Systematic Analysis of Transmitter Coexpression Reveals Organizing Principles of Local Interneuron Heterogeneity</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Broad neuronal classes are surprisingly heterogeneous across many parameters, and subclasses often exhibit partially overlapping traits including transmitter coexpression. However, the extent to which transmitter coexpression occurs in predictable, consistent patterns is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that pairwise coexpression of GABA and multiple neuropeptide families by olfactory local interneurons (LNs) of the moth &lt;i&gt;Manduca sexta&lt;/i&gt; is highly heterogeneous, with a single LN capable of expressing neuropeptides from at least four peptide families and few instances in which neuropeptides are consistently coexpressed. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that observed coexpression patterns cannot be explained by independent probabilities of expression of each neuropeptide. Our analyses point to three organizing principles that, once taken into consideration, allow replication of overall coexpression structure: (1) peptidergic neurons are highly likely to coexpress GABA; (2) expression probability of allatotropin depends on myoinhibitory peptide expression; and (3) the all-or-none coexpression patterns of tachykinin neurons with several other neuropeptides. For other peptide pairs, the presence of one peptide was not predictive of the presence of the other, and coexpression probability could be replicated by independent probabilities. The stochastic nature of these coexpression patterns highlights the heterogeneity of transmitter content among LNs and argues against clear-cut definition of subpopulation types based on the presence of single neuropeptides. Furthermore, the receptors for all neuropeptides and GABA were expressed within each population of principal neuron type in the antennal lobe (AL). Thus, activation of any given LN results in a dynamic cocktail of modulators that have the potential to influence every level of olfactory processing within the AL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Small GTP-converting enzymes, GTPases, are essential for the efficient completion of many physiological and developmental processes. They are regulated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39&lt;/i&gt;, also known as preoptic regulatory factor-2 (Porf-2) or Vilse, a member of the Rho GAP group, was first identified in 1990 in the rat CNS. It has since been shown to regulate apoptosis, cell migration, neurogenesis, and cerebral and hippocampal dendritic spine morphology. It plays a pivotal role in neurodevelopment and learning and memory. Homologous or orthologous genes are found in more than 280 vertebrate and invertebrate species, suggesting preservation through evolution. Not surprisingly, loss of the &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; gene in mice manifests as an embryonic lethal condition. Although &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; is highly expressed in the brain, it is also widely distributed throughout the body, with potential additional roles in oncogenesis and morphogenesis. This review summarizes, for the first time, the known information about this gene under its various names, in addition to considering its transcripts and proteins. The majority of findings described have been made in rats, mice, humans, and fruit flies. This work surveys the known functions, functional mediators, variables modifying expression and upstream regulators of expression, and potential physiological and pathological roles of &lt;i&gt;Arhgap39/Porf-2&lt;/i&gt; in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Functional Categories of Visuomotor Neurons in Macaque Frontal Eye Field</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Frontal eye field (FEF) in macaque monkeys contributes to visual attention, visual–motor transformations and production of eye movements. Traditionally, neurons in FEF have been classified by the magnitude of increased discharge rates following visual stimulus presentation, during a waiting period, and associated with eye movement production. However, considerable heterogeneity remains within the traditional visual, visuomovement, and movement categories. Cluster analysis is a data-driven method of identifying self-segregating groups within a dataset. Because many cluster analysis techniques exist and outcomes vary with analysis assumptions, consensus clustering aggregates over multiple analyses, identifying robust groups. To describe more comprehensively the neuronal composition of FEF, we applied a consensus clustering technique for unsupervised categorization of patterns of spike rate modulation measured during a memory-guided saccade task. We report 10 functional categories, expanding on the traditional 3 categories. Categories were distinguished by latency, magnitude, and sign of visual response; the presence of sustained activity; and the dynamics, magnitude and sign of saccade-related modulation. Consensus clustering can include other metrics and can be applied to datasets from other brain regions to provide better information guiding microcircuit models of cortical function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Bringing Order to the Cognitive Fallacy Zoo. (arXiv:1810.06710v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the eyes of a rationalist like Descartes or Spinoza, human reasoning is
flawless, marching toward uncovering ultimate truth. A few centuries later,
however, culminating in the work of Kahneman and Tversky, human reasoning was
portrayed as anything but flawless, filled with numerous misjudgments, biases,
and cognitive fallacies. With further investigations, new cognitive fallacies
continually emerged, leading to a state of affairs which can fairly be
characterized as the cognitive fallacy zoo! In this largely methodological
work, we formally present a principled way to bring order to this zoo. We
introduce the idea of establishing implication relationships (IRs) between
cognitive fallacies, formally characterizing how one fallacy implies another.
IR is analogous to, and partly inspired by, the fundamental concept of
reduction in computational complexity theory. We present several examples of
IRs involving experimentally well-documented cognitive fallacies: base-rate
neglect, availability bias, conjunction fallacy, decoy effect, framing effect,
and Allais paradox. We conclude by discussing how our work: (i) allows for
identifying those pivotal cognitive fallacies whose investigation would be the
most rewarding research agenda, and importantly (ii) permits a systematized,
guided research program on cognitive fallacies, motivating influential
theoretical as well as experimental avenues of future research.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Characterization of small fiber pathology in a mouse model of Fabry disease</title>

	<description>Fabry disease (FD) is a life-threatening X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by α-galactosidase A (α-GAL) deficiency. Small fiber pathology and pain are major FD symptoms of unknown pathophysiology. α-GAL deficient mice (GLA KO) age-dependently accumulate globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons paralleled by endoplasmic stress and apoptosis as contributors to skin denervation. Old GLA KO mice show increased TRPV1 protein in DRG neurons and heat hypersensitivity upon i.pl. capsaicin. In turn, GLA KO mice are protected from heat and mechanical hypersensitivity in neuropathic and inflammatory pain models based on reduced neuronal I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 currents. We show that in vitro α-GAL silencing increases intracellular Gb3 accumulation paralleled by loss of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 currents, which is reversed by incubation with agalsidase-α and lucerastat. We provide first evidence of a direct Gb3 effect on neuronal integrity and ion channel function as potential mechanism underlying pain and small fiber pathology in FD.</description>

	<description>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are mucosal defense effectors of the human innate immune response. In the intestine, AMPs are produced and secreted by epithelial cells to protect the host against pathogens and to support homeostasis with commensals. The inducible nature of AMPs suggests that potent inducers could be used to increase...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/jgL7EfXs1zQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The signaling cascades triggered by the cross-linkage of immunoglobulin E (IgE) with its high-affinity receptor (FcεRI) on mast cells contribute to multiple allergic disorders, such as asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Restraint of intracellular signals for mast cell activation is essential to restore homeostasis. In this study, we found that...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/NxVY0KBiT7Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Memory T helper (mTh) cells play important roles in the reinfection of pathogens and drive the pathogenesis of diseases. While recent studies have characterized the pathogenic mTh2 cell subpopulations driving allergic inflammation, those that induce immune responses against helminth infection remain unknown. We found that IL-5–producing CXCR6+ST2+CD44+ mTh2 cells play...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/4HHjN_CdAYI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Ecologists debate the relative importance of selective vs. neutral processes in understanding biodiversity. This debate is especially pertinent to microbial communities, which play crucial roles in areas such as health, disease, industry, and the environment. Here, we created a synthetic microbial community using heritable genetic barcodes and tracked community composition...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/6DDS_UAW7t0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Proliferative gastrointestinal (GI) tissue is radiation-sensitive, and heavy-ion space radiation with its high-linear energy transfer (high-LET) and higher damaging potential than low-LET γ-rays is predicted to compromise astronauts’ GI function. However, much uncertainty remains in our understanding of how heavy ions affect coordinated epithelial cell migration and extrusion, which are...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/IQDFJXcAKIE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Optimal Evidence Accumulation on Social Networks. (arXiv:1810.05909v1 [physics.soc-ph])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05909</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental question in biology is how organisms integrate sensory and
social evidence to make decisions. However, few models describe how both these
streams of information can be combined to optimize choices. Here we develop a
normative model for collective decision making in a network of agents
performing a two-alternative forced choice task. We assume that rational
(Bayesian) agents in this network make private measurements, and observe the
decisions of their neighbors until they accumulate sufficient evidence to make
an irreversible choice. As each agent communicates its decision to those
observing it, the flow of social information is described by a directed graph.
The decision-making process in this setting is intuitive, but can be complex.
We describe when and how the absence of a decision of a neighboring agent
communicates social information, and how an agent must marginalize over all
unobserved decisions. We also show how decision thresholds and network
connectivity affect group evidence accumulation, and describe the dynamics of
decision making in social cliques. Our model provides a bridge between the
abstractions used in the economics literature and the evidence accumulator
models used widely in neuroscience and psychology.

	<description>We propose a framework for the memory function of spindle oscillations during sleep. In this framework, memories are reinstated by spindle events, and further reprocessed during subsequent spindle refractory periods. We posit that spindle refractoriness is crucial for protecting memory reprocessing from interference. We further argue that temporally-coordinated spindle refractory periods across local networks facilitate the consolidation of rich, multimodal representations, and that localized spindle refractoriness optimizes oscillatory interactions that support systems consolidation in the sleeping brain.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Internal but not external noise frees working memory resources</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Tomić, Paul M. Bays&lt;/p&gt;

The precision with which visual information can be recalled from working memory declines as the number of items in memory increases. This finding has been explained in terms of the distribution of a limited representational resource between items. Here we investigated how the sensory strength of memoranda affects resource allocation. We manipulated signal strength of an orientation stimulus in two ways: we varied the internal (sensory) noise by adjusting stimulus contrast, and varied the external (stimulus) noise by altering the within-stimulus variability. Both manipulations had similar effects on the precision with which the orientation could be recalled, but differed in their impact on memory for other stimuli. These results indicate that increasing internal noise released resources that could be used to store other stimuli more precisely; increasing external noise had no such effect. We show that these observations can be captured by a simple neural model of working memory encoding, in which spiking activity takes on the role of the limited resource.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/532tuGBOm9M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo. (arXiv:1810.05558v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05558</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05558</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many probabilistic models of interest in scientific computing and machine
learning have expensive, black-box likelihoods that prevent the application of
standard techniques for Bayesian inference, such as MCMC, which would require
access to the gradient or a large number of likelihood evaluations. We
introduce here a novel sample-efficient inference framework, Variational
Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC). VBMC combines variational inference with
Gaussian-process based, active-sampling Bayesian quadrature, using the latter
to efficiently approximate the intractable integral in the variational
objective. Our method produces both a nonparametric approximation of the
posterior distribution and an approximate lower bound of the model evidence,
useful for model selection. We demonstrate VBMC both on several synthetic
likelihoods and on a neuronal model with data from real neurons. Across all
tested problems and dimensions (up to $D = 10$), VBMC performs consistently
well in reconstructing the posterior and the model evidence with a limited
budget of likelihood evaluations, unlike other methods that work only in very
low dimensions. Our framework shows great promise as a novel tool for posterior
and model inference with expensive, black-box likelihoods.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Cortical Balance Between ON and OFF Visual Responses Is Modulated by the Spatial Properties of the Visual Stimulus</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The primary visual cortex of carnivores and primates is dominated by the OFF visual pathway and responds more strongly to dark than light stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that this cortical OFF dominance is modulated by the size and spatial frequency of the stimulus in awake primates and we uncover a main neuronal mechanism underlying this modulation. We show that large grating patterns with low spatial frequencies drive five times more OFF-dominated than ON-dominated neurons, but this pronounced cortical OFF dominance is strongly reduced when the grating size decreases and the spatial frequency increases, as when the stimulus moves away from the observer. We demonstrate that the reduction in cortical OFF dominance is not caused by a selective reduction of visual responses in OFF-dominated neurons but by a change in the ON/OFF response balance of neurons with diverse receptive field properties that can be ON or OFF dominated, simple, or complex. We conclude that cortical OFF dominance is continuously adjusted by a neuronal mechanism that modulates ON/OFF response balance in multiple cortical neurons when the spatial properties of the visual stimulus change with viewing distance and/or optical blur.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>After injury, activation and recruitment of inflammatory and immune cells has been thought to occur throughout the whole body. A recent study shows that after brain injury in mice, immune cells are primarily recruited from nearby skull bone marrow and invade the brain through microscopic vascular channels. Manipulation of this process may provide new therapeutic options.</description>

	<description>Converging evidence across species highlights the contribution of environmental stress to anhedonia (loss of pleasure and/or motivation). However, despite a clear link between stress and the emergence of anhedonic-like behavior in both human and animal models, the underlying biological pathways remain elusive. Here, we synthesize recent findings across multiple levels, from molecular signaling pathways through whole-brain networks, to discuss mechanisms through which stress may influence anhedonia.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: State dependence of stimulus-induced variability tuning in macaque MT</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006527</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Joseph A. Lombardo, Matthew V. Macellaio, Bing Liu, Stephanie E. Palmer, Leslie C. Osborne&lt;/p&gt;

Behavioral states marked by varying levels of arousal and attention modulate some properties of cortical responses (e.g. average firing rates or pairwise correlations), yet it is not fully understood what drives these response changes and how they might affect downstream stimulus decoding. Here we show that changes in state modulate the tuning of response variance-to-mean ratios (Fano factors) in a fashion that is neither predicted by a Poisson spiking model nor changes in the mean firing rate, with a substantial effect on stimulus discriminability. We recorded motion-sensitive neurons in middle temporal cortex (MT) in two states: alert fixation and light, opioid anesthesia. Anesthesia tended to lower average spike counts, without decreasing trial-to-trial variability compared to the alert state. Under anesthesia, within-trial fluctuations in excitability were correlated over longer time scales compared to the alert state, creating supra-Poisson Fano factors. In contrast, alert-state MT neurons have higher mean firing rates and largely sub-Poisson variability that is stimulus-dependent and cannot be explained by firing rate differences alone. The absence of such stimulus-induced variability tuning in the anesthetized state suggests different sources of variability between states. A simple model explains state-dependent shifts in the distribution of observed Fano factors via a suppression in the variance of gain fluctuations in the alert state. A population model with stimulus-induced variability tuning and behaviorally constrained information-limiting correlations explores the potential enhancement in stimulus discriminability by the cortical population in the alert state.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I5VLXmddQbU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Complex problem solving is a high level cognitive process which has been
thoroughly studied over the last decade. The Tower of London (TOL) is a task
that has been widely used to study problem-solving. In this study, we aim to
explore the underlying cognitive network dynamics among anatomical regions of
complex problem solving and its sub-phases, namely planning and execution. A
new brain network construction model establishing dynamic functional brain
networks using fMRI is proposed. The first step of the model is a preprocessing
pipeline that manages to decrease the spatial redundancy while increasing the
temporal resolution of the fMRI recordings. Then, dynamic brain networks are
estimated using artificial neural networks. The network properties of the
estimated brain networks are studied in order to identify regions of interest,
such as hubs and subgroups of densely connected brain regions. The major
similarities and dissimilarities of the network structure of planning and
execution phases are highlighted. Our findings show the hubs and clusters of
densely interconnected regions during both subtasks. It is observed that there
are more hubs during the planning phase compared to the execution phase, and
the clusters are more strongly connected during planning compared to execution.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Self-organized traffic via priority rules in leaf-cutting ants</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Strömbom, Audrey Dussutour&lt;/p&gt;

Ants, termites and humans often form well-organized and highly efficient trails between different locations. Yet the microscopic traffic rules responsible for this organization and efficiency are not fully understood. In previous experimental studies with leaf-cutting ants (&lt;i&gt;Atta colombica&lt;/i&gt;), a set of local priority rules were isolated and it was proposed that these rules govern the temporal and spatial organization of the traffic on the trails. Here we introduce a model based on these priority rules to investigate whether they are sufficient to produce traffic similar to that observed in the experiments on both a narrow and a wider trail. We establish that the model is able to reproduce key characteristics of the traffic on the trails. In particular, we show that the proposed priority rules induce de-synchronization into clusters of inbound and outbound ants on a narrow trail, and that priority-type dependent segregated traffic emerges on a wider trail. Due to the generic nature of the proposed priority rules we speculate that they may be used to model traffic organization in a variety of other ant species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mqMMX0_JVcg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Fly development amazes us by the precision and reproducibility of gene expression, especially since the initial expression patterns are established during very short nuclear cycles. Recent live imaging of &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt; promoter dynamics shows a stable steep binary expression pattern established within the three minute interphase of nuclear cycle 11. Considering expression models of different complexity, we explore the trade-off between the ability of a regulatory system to produce a steep boundary and minimize expression variability between different nuclei. We show how a limited readout time imposed by short developmental cycles affects the gene’s ability to read positional information along the embryo’s anterior posterior axis and express reliably. Comparing our theoretical results to real-time monitoring of the &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt; transcription dynamics in live flies, we discuss possible regulatory strategies, suggesting an important role for additional binding sites, gradients or non-equilibrium binding and modified transcription factor search strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NmHDABd2idw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The states and parameters of neural mass models were tracked during a total of over 3000 seizures from twelve patients with focal epilepsy. These models provide an estimate of the effective connectivity within intracortical circuits over the time course of seizures. Observing the dynamics of effective connectivity provides insight into mechanisms of seizures. Estimation of patients seizure dynamics revealed: 1) a highly stereotyped pattern of evolution for each patient, 2) distinct sub-groups of onset mechanisms amongst patients, and 3) different offset mechanisms for long and short seizures. Stereotypical dynamics suggest that, once initiated, seizures follow a deterministic path through the parameter space of a neural model. Furthermore, distinct sub-populations of patients were identified based on characteristic motifs in the dynamics at seizure onset. There were also distinct patterns between long and short duration seizures that were related to seizure offset. Understanding how these different patterns of seizure evolution arise may provide new insights into brain function and guide treatment for epilepsy, since specific therapies may have preferential effects on the various parameters that could potentially be individualized. Methods that unite computational models with data provide a powerful means to generate testable hypotheses for further experimental research. This work provides a demonstration that the hidden connectivity parameters of a neural mass model can be dynamically inferred from data. Our results underscore the power of theoretical models to inform epilepsy management. It is our hope that this work guides further efforts to apply computational models to clinical data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FP4XLutG9Ic&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Ten quick tips for getting the most scientific value out of numerical data</title>

Most studies in the life sciences and other disciplines involve generating and analyzing numerical data of some type as the foundation for scientific findings. Working with numerical data involves multiple challenges. These include reproducible data acquisition, appropriate data storage, computationally correct data analysis, appropriate reporting and presentation of the results, and suitable data interpretation.
Finding and correcting mistakes when analyzing and interpreting data can be frustrating and time-consuming. Presenting or publishing incorrect results is embarrassing but not uncommon. Particular sources of errors are inappropriate use of statistical methods and incorrect interpretation of data by software. To detect mistakes as early as possible, one should frequently check intermediate and final results for plausibility. Clearly documenting how quantities and results were obtained facilitates correcting mistakes. Properly understanding data is indispensable for reaching well-founded conclusions from experimental results. Units are needed to make sense of numbers, and uncertainty should be estimated to know how meaningful results are. Descriptive statistics and significance testing are useful tools for interpreting numerical results if applied correctly. However, blindly trusting in computed numbers can also be misleading, so it is worth thinking about how data should be summarized quantitatively to properly answer the question at hand. Finally, a suitable form of presentation is needed so that the data can properly support the interpretation and findings. By additionally sharing the relevant data, others can access, understand, and ultimately make use of the results.
These quick tips are intended to provide guidelines for correctly interpreting, efficiently analyzing, and presenting numerical data in a useful way.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OAsr7tu2D9w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work the stochastic generalization of single Hodgkin-Huxley neuron is
further extended to unidirectionally coupled neurons. Our main focus is to
elucidate the role of channel noise in the kinetics and energetics of spiking
of action potential and the synchronization between two coupled neurons. We
have found that the size of the patch is playing the pivotal role in
synchronization and metabolic energy consumption. For example, there exists
three different patch size ranges in which coupled neuron system behaves in a
different manner from noise enhanced phase to dead range state before reaching
the deterministic limit. We have also found that the sodium and potassium
channel blockers have characteristic kinetic and energetic effects on
synchronization process and metabolic energy consumption rate which has been
validated with the simulated data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper is to derive a mathematical model for neuron by imposing only a
principle of symmetry that two modelers must come up with the same model when
one is approaching the problem by modeling the conductances of ion channels and

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Designing artificial cyber-agents able to interact with human safely, smartly
and in a natural way is a current open problem in control. Solving such an
issue will allow the design of cyber-agents capable of co-operatively
interacting with people in order to fulfil common joint tasks in a multitude of
different applications. This is particularly relevant in the context of
healthcare applications. Indeed, the use has been proposed of artificial agents
interacting and coordinating their movements with those of a patient suffering
from social or motor disorders. Specifically, it has been shown that an
artificial agent exhibiting certain kinematic properties could provide
innovative and efficient rehabilitation strategies for these patients.
Moreover, it has also been shown that the level of motor coordination is
enhanced if these kinematic properties are similar to those of the individual
it is interacting with. In this paper we discuss, first, a new method based on
Markov Chains to confer &quot;human motor characteristics&quot; on a virtual agent, so as
that it can coordinate its motion with that of a target individual while
exhibiting specific kinematic properties. Then, we embed such synthetic model
in a control architecture based on reinforcement learning to synthesize a
cyber-agent able to mimic the behaviour of a specific human performing a joint
motor task with one or more individuals.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Pre-Synaptic Pool Modification (PSPM): A Supervised Learning Procedure for Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:1810.03199v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03199</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03199</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A central question in neuroscience is how to develop realistic models that
predict output firing behavior based on provided external stimulus. Given a set
of external inputs and a set of output spike trains, the objective is to
discover a network structure which can accomplish the transformation as
accurately as possible. Due to the difficulty of this problem in its most
general form, approximations have been made in previous work. Past
approximations have sacrificed network size, recurrence, allowed spiked count,
or have imposed layered network structure. Here we present a learning rule
without these sacrifices, which produces a weight matrix of a leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) network to match the output activity of both
deterministic LIF networks as well as probabilistic integrate-and-fire (PIF)
networks. Inspired by synaptic scaling, our pre-synaptic pool modification
(PSPM) algorithm outputs deterministic, fully recurrent spiking neural networks
that can provide a novel generative model for given spike trains. Similarity in
output spike trains is evaluated with a variety of metrics including a
van-Rossum like measure and a numerical comparison of inter-spike interval
distributions. Application of our algorithm to randomly generated networks
improves similarity to the reference spike trains on both of these stated
measures. In addition, we generated LIF networks that operate near criticality
when trained on critical PIF outputs. Our results establish that learning rules
based on synaptic homeostasis can be used to represent input-output
relationships in fully recurrent spiking neural networks.

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells are one of the earliest populations of neurons in the cerebral cortex of rodents and primates, and they play a critical role in corticogenesis and cortical lamination during neocortical development. However, a comprehensive morphological and physiological profile of CR cells in the mouse neocortex has not yet been established. Here, we systematically investigated the dynamic development of CR cells in Tg(Ebf2-EGFP)58Gsat/Mmcd mice. The morphological complexity, membrane activities and presynaptic inputs of CR cells coordinately increase and reach a plateau at P5–P9 before regressing. Using 3D reconstruction, we delineated a parallel-stratification pattern of the axonal extension of CR cells. Furthermore, we found that the morphological structure and presynaptic inputs of CR cells were disturbed in Reelin-deficient mice. These findings confirm that CR cells undergo a transient maturation process in layer 1 before disappearing. Importantly, Reelin deficiency impairs the formation of synaptic connections onto CR cells. In conclusion, our results provide insights into the rapid maturation and axonal stratification of CR cells in layer 1. These findings suggest that both the electrophysiological activities and the morphology of CR cells provide vital guidance for the modulation of early circuits, in a Reelin-dependent manner.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sequence Alterations of Cortical Genes Linked to Individual Connectivity of the Human Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individual differences in humans are driven by unique brain structural and functional profiles, presumably mediated in part through differential cortical gene expression. However, the relationships between cortical gene expression profiles and individual differences in large-scale neural network organization remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the magnitude of sequence alterations in regional cortical genes mapped onto brain areas with high degree of functional connectivity variability across individuals. First, human genetic expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas was used to identify protein-coding genes associated with cortical areas, which delineated the regional genetic signature of specific cortical areas based on sequence alteration profiles. Thereafter, we identified brain regions that manifested high degrees of individual variability by using test-retest functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging and graph-theory analyses in healthy subjects. We found that rates of genetic &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;sequence alterations&lt;/span&gt; shared a distinct spatial topography with cortical regions exhibiting individualized (highly-variable) connectivity profiles. Interestingly, gene expression profiles of brain regions with highly individualized connectivity patterns and elevated number of sequence alterations are devoted to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;neuropeptide-signaling-pathways&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;chemical-synaptic-transmission&lt;/span&gt;. Our findings support that genetic &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;sequence alterations&lt;/span&gt; may underlie important aspects of brain connectome individualities in humans.Significance Statement: The neurobiological underpinnings of our individuality as humans are still an unsolved question. Although the notion that genetic variation drives an individual’s brain organization has been previously postulated, specific links between neural connectivity and gene expression profiles have remained elusive. In this study, we identified the magnitude of population-based sequence alterations in discrete cortical regions and compared them to the brain topological distribution of functional connectivity variability across an independent human sample. We discovered that brain regions with high degree of connectional individuality are defined by increased rates of genetic sequence alterations; these findings specifically implicated genes involved in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;neuropeptide-signaling pathways&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;chemical-synaptic transmission&lt;/span&gt;. These observations support that genetic &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;sequence alterations&lt;/span&gt; may underlie important aspects of the emergence of the brain individuality across humans.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sparse Representation in Awake Auditory Cortex: Cell-type Dependence, Synaptic Mechanisms, Developmental Emergence, and Modulation</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sparse representation is considered an important coding strategy for cortical processing in various sensory modalities. It remains unclear how cortical sparseness arises and is being regulated. Here, unbiased recordings from primary auditory cortex of awake adult mice revealed salient sparseness in layer (L)2/3, with a majority of excitatory neurons exhibiting no increased spiking in response to each of sound types tested. Sparse representation was not observed in parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory neurons. The nonresponding neurons did receive auditory-evoked synaptic inputs, marked by weaker excitation and lower excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratios than responding cells. Sparse representation arises during development in an experience-dependent manner, accompanied by differential changes of excitatory input strength and a transition from unimodal to bimodal distribution of E/I ratios. Sparseness level could be reduced by suppressing PV or L1 inhibitory neurons. Thus, sparse representation may be dynamically regulated via modulating E/I balance, optimizing cortical representation of the external sensory world.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural stem cell lineage-specific cannabinoid type-1 receptor regulates neurogenesis and plasticity in the adult mouse hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse hippocampus occur in a specific neurogenic niche, where a multitude of extracellular signaling molecules converges to regulate NSC proliferation as well as fate and functional integration. However, the underlying mechanisms how NSCs react to extrinsic signals and convert them to intracellular responses still remains elusive. NSCs contain a functional endocannabinoid system, including the cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1). To decipher whether CB1 regulates adult neurogenesis directly or indirectly &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/span&gt;, we performed NSC-specific conditional inactivation of CB1 by using triple-transgenic mice. Here, we show that lack of CB1 in NSCs is sufficient to decrease proliferation of the stem cell pool, which consequently leads to a reduction in the number of newborn neurons. Furthermore, neuronal differentiation was compromised at the level of dendritic maturation pointing towards a postsynaptic role of CB1 &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/span&gt;. Deteriorated neurogenesis in NSC-specific CB1 knock-outs additionally resulted in reduced long-term potentiation in the hippocampal formation. The observed cellular and physiological alterations led to decreased short-term spatial memory and increased depression-like behavior. These results demonstrate that CB1 expressed in NSCs and their progeny controls neurogenesis in adult mice to regulate the NSC stem cell pool, dendritic morphology, activity-dependent plasticity, and behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;With increasing attention on the developmental causes of neuropsychiatric disorders, appropriate animal models are crucial to identifying causes and assessing potential interventions. The common marmoset is an ideal model as it has sophisticated social/emotional behavior, reaching adulthood within 2 years of birth. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in an accelerated longitudinal cohort (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 41; aged 3–27 months; scanned 2–7 times over 2 years). Splines were used to model nonlinear trajectories of grey matter volume development in 53 cortical areas and 16 subcortical nuclei. Generally, volumes increased before puberty, peaked, and declined into adulthood. We identified 3 milestones of grey matter development: I) age at peak volume; II) age at onset of volume decline; and III) age at maximum rate of volume decline. These milestones differentiated growth trajectories of primary sensory/motor cortical areas from those of association cortex but also revealed distinct trajectories between association cortices. Cluster analysis of trajectories showed that prefrontal cortex was the most heterogenous of association regions, comprising areas with distinct milestones and developmental trajectories. These results highlight the potential of high-field structural MRI to define the dynamics of primate brain development and importantly to identify when specific prefrontal circuits may be most vulnerable to environmental impact.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: CAPON Is a Critical Protein in Synaptic Molecular Networks in the Prefrontal Cortex of Mood Disorder Patients and Contributes to Depression-Like Behavior in a Mouse Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy254</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Aberrant regulation and activity of synaptic proteins may cause synaptic pathology in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mood disorder patients. Carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of NOS1 (CAPON) is a critical scaffold protein linked to synaptic proteins like nitric oxide synthase 1, synapsins. We hypothesized that CAPON is altered together with its interacting synaptic proteins in the PFC in mood disorder patients and may contribute to depression-like behaviors in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Here, we found that CAPON-immunoreactivity (ir) was significantly increased in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex in major depressive disorder (MDD), which was accompanied by an upregulation of spinophilin-ir and a downregulation of synapsin-ir. The increases in CAPON and spinophilin and the decrease in synapsin in the DLPFC of MDD patients were also seen in the PFC of CUMS mice. CAPON-ir positively correlated with spinophilin-ir (but not with synapsin-ir) in mood disorder patients. CAPON colocalized with spinophilin in the DLPFC of MDD patients and interacted with spinophilin in human brain. Viral-mediated CAPON downregulation in the medial PFC notably reversed the depression-like behaviors in the CUMS mice. These data suggest that CAPON may contribute to aspects of depressive behavior, possibly as an interacting protein for spinophilin in the PFC.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Isozyme-Specific Role of SAD-A in Neuronal Migration During Development of Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy253</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy253/5126799?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;SAD kinases regulate presynaptic vesicle clustering and neuronal polarization. A previous report demonstrated that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sadb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; double-mutant mice showed perinatal lethality with a severe defect in axon/dendrite differentiation, but their single mutants did not. These results indicated that they were functionally redundant. Surprisingly, we show that on a C57BL/6N background, SAD-A is essential for cortical development whereas SAD-B is dispensable. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice died within a few days after birth. Their cortical lamination pattern was disorganized and radial migration of cortical neurons was perturbed. Birth date analyses with BrdU and in utero electroporation using pCAG-EGFP vector showed a delayed migration of cortical neurons to the pial surface in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Time-lapse imaging of these mice confirmed slow migration velocity in the cortical plate. While the neurites of hippocampal neurons in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice could ultimately differentiate in culture to form axons and dendrites, the average length of their axons was shorter than that of the wild type. Thus, analysis on a different genetic background than that used initially revealed a nonredundant role for SAD-A in neuronal migration and differentiation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Pace of Neurogenesis Is Regulated by the Transient Retention of the Apical Endfeet of Differentiating Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy252</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The development of the mammalian cerebral cortex involves a variety of temporally organized events such as successive waves of neuronal production and the transition of progenitor competence for each neuronal subtype generated. The number of neurons generated in a certain time period, that is, the rate of neuron production, varies across the regions of the brain and the specific developmental stage; however, the underlying mechanism of this process is poorly understood. We have recently found that nascent neurons communicate with undifferentiated progenitors and thereby regulate neurogenesis, through a transiently retained apical endfoot that signals via the Notch pathway. Here, we report that the retention time length of the neuronal apical endfoot correlates with the rate of neuronal production in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. We further demonstrate that a forced reduction or extension of the retention period through the disruption or stabilization of adherens junction, respectively, resulted in the acceleration or deceleration of neurogenesis, respectively. Our results suggest that the apical endfeet of differentiating cells serve as a pace controller for neurogenesis, thereby assuring the well-proportioned laminar organization of the neocortex.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Heritability of Gray Matter Structural Covariation and Tool Use Skills in Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): A Source-Based Morphometry and Quantitative Genetic Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Nonhuman primates, and great apes in particular, possess a variety of cognitive abilities thought to underlie human brain and cognitive evolution, most notably, the manufacture and use of tools. In a relatively large sample (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 226) of captive chimpanzees (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pan troglodytes&lt;/span&gt;) for whom pedigrees are well known, the overarching aim of the current study was to investigate the source of heritable variation in brain structure underlying tool use skills. Specifically, using source-based morphometry (SBM), a multivariate analysis of naturally occurring patterns of covariation in gray matter across the brain, we investigated (1) the genetic contributions to variation in SBM components, (2) sex and age effects for each component, and (3) phenotypic and genetic associations between SBM components and tool use skill. Results revealed important sex- and age-related differences across largely heritable SBM components and associations between structural covariation and tool use skill. Further, shared genetic mechanisms appear to account for a heritable link between variation in both the capacity to use tools and variation in morphology of the superior limb of the superior temporal sulcus and adjacent parietal cortex. Findings represent the first evidence of heritability of structural covariation in gray matter among nonhuman primates.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Functional Parcellation of the Cerebral Cortex Across the Human Adult Lifespan</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Adult aging is associated with differences in structure, function, and connectivity of brain areas. Age-based brain comparisons have typically rested on the assumption that brain areas exhibit a similar spatial organization across age; we evaluate this hypothesis directly. Area parcellation methods that identify locations where resting-state functional correlations (RSFC) exhibit abrupt transitions (boundary-mapping) are used to define cortical areas in cohorts of individuals sampled across a large range of the human adult lifespan (20–93 years). Most of the strongest areal boundaries are spatially consistent across age. Differences in parcellation boundaries are largely explained by differences in cortical thickness and anatomical alignment in older relative to younger adults. Despite the parcellation similarities, age-specific parcellations exhibit better internal validity relative to a young-adult parcellation applied to older adults’ data, and age-specific parcels are better able to capture variability in task-evoked functional activity. Incorporating age-specific parcels as nodes in RSFC network analysis reveals that the spatial topography of the brain’s large-scale system organization is comparable throughout aging, but confirms that the segregation of systems declines with increasing age. These observations demonstrate that many features of areal organization are consistent across adulthood, and reveal sources of age-related brain variation that contribute to the differences.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ernest C. Y. Ho, Juan Nicolas Malagón, Abha Ahuja, Rama Singh, Ellen Larsen&lt;/p&gt;

The morphogenesis of sex combs (SCs), a male trait in many species of fruit flies, is an excellent system in which to study the cell biology, genetics and evolution of a trait. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, where the incipient SC rotates from horizontal to a vertical position, three signal comb properties have been documented: length, final angle and shape (linearity). During SC rotation, in which many cellular processes are occurring both spatially and temporally, it is difficult to distinguish which processes are crucial for which attributes of the comb. We have used a novel approach combining simulations and experiments to uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics underlying SC rotation. Our results indicate that 1) the final SC shape is primarily controlled by the inhomogeneity of initial cell size in cells close to the immature comb, 2) the final angle is primarily controlled by later cell expansion and 3) a temporal sequence of cell expansion mitigates the malformations generally associated with longer rotated SCs. Overall, our work has linked together the morphological diversity of SCs and the cellular dynamics behind such diversity, thus providing important insights on how evolution may affect SC development via the behaviours of surrounding epithelial cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EZcUqc7bSzc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modulation of Beta Bursts in the Subthalamic Nucleus Predicts Motor Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8905?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence suggests a role of beta-band oscillations in voluntary movements. However, most of the studies linking beta power to motor performance are based on data averaged across trials that ignore the fast dynamics of oscillatory activity and trial-to-trial variations in motor responses. Recently, emphasis has shifted from the functional implications of the mean beta power to the presence and nature of episodic bursts of beta activity. Here we test the hypothesis that beta bursts, though short in duration in more physiological state, may help explain spontaneous variations in motor behavior of human adults at the single-trial level. To this end, we recorded local field potential activity from the subthalamic nucleus of parkinsonian patients of both genders whose motor behavior had been normalized as far as possible through treatment with the dopamine prodrug, levodopa. We found that beta bursts present in a time-limited window well before movement onset in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus reduce the peak velocity of that movement and that this effect is further amplified by the amplitude of the burst. Additionally, prolonged reaction times are observed when bursts occur immediately after the GO cue. Together, these results suggest that the modulation of the timing and amplitude of beta bursts might serve to dynamically adapt motor performance. These results offer new insight in the pathology of Parkinson's disease, and suggest that beta bursts whose presence and nature are modulated by context may have a physiological role in modulating behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Beta oscillations (~13–30 Hz) have been increasingly interpreted as transient bursts rather than as rhythmically sustained oscillations (Feingold et al., 2015). Prolonged and increased probability of beta bursts in the subthalamic nucleus correlates with the severity of motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (Tinkhauser et al., 2017a, b). However, it remains unclear whether beta bursts act to modify motor performance on a trial-by-trial basis under more physiological condition. Here, we found that, according to the time window in which they fall, beta bursts reduced the velocity of the forthcoming movement or prolonged the reaction time. These results offer new insight in the pathology of Parkinson's disease and also suggest that the modulation of beta bursts might serve to dynamically adapt motor performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Microglia Play an Active Role in Obesity-Associated Cognitive Decline</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8889?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Obesity affects &amp;gt;600 million people worldwide, a staggering number that appears to be on the rise. One of the lesser known consequences of obesity is its deleterious effects on cognition, which have been well documented across many cognitive domains and age groups. To investigate the cellular mechanisms that underlie obesity-associated cognitive decline, we used diet-induced obesity in male mice and found memory impairments along with reductions in dendritic spines, sites of excitatory synapses, increases in the activation of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, and increases in synaptic profiles within microglia, in the hippocampus, a brain region linked to cognition. We found that partial knockdown of the receptor for fractalkine, a chemokine that can serve as a &quot;find me&quot; cue for microglia, prevented microglial activation and cognitive decline induced by obesity. Furthermore, we found that pharmacological inhibition of microglial activation in obese mice was associated with prevention of both dendritic spine loss and cognitive degradation. Finally, we observed that pharmacological blockade of microglial phagocytosis lessened obesity-associated cognitive decline. These findings suggest that microglia play an active role in obesity-associated cognitive decline by phagocytosis of synapses that are important for optimal function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Obesity in humans correlates with reduced cognitive function. To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying this, we used diet-induced obesity in mice and found impaired performance on cognitive tests of hippocampal function. These deficits were accompanied by reduced numbers of dendritic spines, increased microglial activation, and increased synaptic profiles within microglia. Inhibition of microglial activation by transgenic and pharmacological methods prevented cognitive decline and dendritic spine loss in obese mice. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of the phagocytic activity of microglia was also sufficient to prevent cognitive degradation. This work suggests that microglia may be responsible for obesity-associated cognitive decline and dendritic spine loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differentiating between Models of Perceptual Decision Making Using Pupil Size Inferred Confidence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8874?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8874?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;During perceptual decisions, subjects often rely more strongly on early, rather than late, sensory evidence, even in tasks when both are equally informative about the correct decision. This early psychophysical weighting has been explained by an integration-to-bound decision process, in which the stimulus is ignored after the accumulated evidence reaches a certain bound, or confidence level. Here, we derive predictions about how the average temporal weighting of the evidence depends on a subject's decision confidence in this model. To test these predictions empirically, we devised a method to infer decision confidence from pupil size in 2 male monkeys performing a disparity discrimination task. Our animals' data confirmed the integration-to-bound predictions, with different internal decision bounds and different levels of correlation between pupil size and decision confidence accounting for differences between animals. However, the data were less compatible with two alternative accounts for early psychophysical weighting: attractor dynamics either within the decision area or due to feedback to sensory areas, or a feedforward account due to neuronal response adaptation. This approach also opens the door to using confidence more broadly when studying the neural basis of decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; An animal's ability to adjust decisions based on its level of confidence, sometimes referred to as &quot;metacognition,&quot; has generated substantial interest in neuroscience. Here, we show how measurements of pupil diameter in macaques can be used to infer their confidence. This technique opens the door to more neurophysiological studies of confidence because it eliminates the need for training on behavioral paradigms to evaluate confidence. We then use this technique to test predictions from competing explanations of why subjects in perceptual decision making often rely more strongly on early evidence: the way in which the strength of this effect should depend on a subject's decision confidence. We find that a bounded decision formation process best explains our empirical data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Spectral Resolution Clustering for Brain Parcellation. (arXiv:1810.04026v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04026</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04026</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We take an image science perspective on the problem of determining brain
network connectivity given functional activity. But adapting the concept of
image resolution to this problem, we provide a new perspective on network
partitioning for individual brain parcellation. The typical goal here is to
determine densely-interconnected subnetworks within a larger network by
choosing the best edges to cut. We instead define these subnetworks as
resolution cells, where highly-correlated activity within the cells makes edge
weights difficult to determine from the data. Subdividing the resolution
estimates into disjoint resolution cells via clustering yields a new variation,
and new perspective, on spectral clustering. This provides insight and
strategies for open questions such as the selection of model order and the
optimal choice of preprocessing steps for functional imaging data. The approach
is demonstrated using functional imaging data, where we find the proposed
approach produces parcellations which are more predictive across multiple scans
versus conventional methods, as well as versus alternative forms of spectral
clustering.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: High Sensitivity Mapping of Cortical Dopamine D2 Receptor Expressing Neurons</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy261/5122732?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical D2 dopamine receptor (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/span&gt;) have mostly been examined in the context of cognitive function regulation and neurotransmission modulation of medial prefrontal cortex by principal neurons and parvalbumin positive, fast-spiking, interneurons in schizophrenia. Early studies suggested the presence of D2 receptors in several cortical areas, albeit with major technical limitations. We used combinations of transgenic reporter systems, recombinase activated viral vectors, quantitative translatome analysis, and high sensitivity in situ hybridization to identify D2 receptor expressing cells and establish a map of their respective projections. Our results identified previously uncharacterized clusters of D2 expressing neurons in limbic and sensory regions of the adult mouse brain cortex. Characterization of these clusters by translatome analysis and cell type specific labeling revealed highly heterogeneous expression of D2 receptors in principal neurons and various populations of interneurons across cortical areas. Transcript enrichment analysis also demonstrated variable levels of D2 receptor expression and several orphan G-protein-coupled receptors coexpression in different neuronal clusters, thus suggesting strategies for genetic and therapeutic targeting of D2 expressing neurons in specific cortical areas. These results pave the way for a thorough re-examination of cortical D2 receptor functions, which could provide information about neuronal circuits involved in psychotic and mood disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Diadenosine-Polyphosphate Analogue AppCH2ppA Suppresses Seizures by Enhancing Adenosine Signaling in the Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epilepsy is a multifactorial disorder associated with neuronal hyperexcitability that affects more than 1% of the human population. It has long been known that adenosine can reduce seizure generation in animal models of epilepsies. However, in addition to various side effects, the instability of adenosine has precluded its use as an anticonvulsant treatment. Here we report that a stable analogue of diadenosine-tetraphosphate: AppCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ppA effectively suppresses spontaneous epileptiform activity in vitro and in vivo in a Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) mouse model (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Tsc1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), and in postsurgery cortical samples from TSC human patients. These effects are mediated by enhanced adenosine signaling in the cortex post local neuronal adenosine release. The released adenosine induces A1 receptor-dependent activation of potassium channels thereby reducing neuronal excitability, temporal summation, and hypersynchronicity. AppCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ppA does not cause any disturbances of the main vital autonomous functions of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Tsc1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/&lt;/span&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; mice in vivo. Therefore, we propose this compound to be a potent new candidate for adenosine-related treatment strategies to suppress intractable epilepsies.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Early Adolescence is a Critical Period for the Maturation of Inhibitory Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy247</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy247/5122728?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Psychiatric conditions marked by impairments in cognitive control often emerge during adolescence, when the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its inputs undergo structural and functional maturation and are vulnerable to disruption by external events. It is not known, however, whether there exists a specific temporal window within the broad range of adolescence when the development of PFC circuitry and its related behaviors are sensitive to disruption. Here we show, in male mice, that repeated exposure to amphetamine during early adolescence leads to impaired behavioral inhibition, aberrant PFC dopamine connectivity, and reduced PFC dopamine function in adulthood. Remarkably, these deficits are not observed following exposure to the exact same amphetamine regimen at later times. These findings demonstrate that there is a critical period for the disruption of the adolescent maturation of cognitive control and PFC dopamine function and suggest that early adolescence is particularly relevant to the emergence of psychopathology in humans.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Saccadic Adaptation Boosts Ongoing Gamma Activity in a Subsequent Visuoattentional Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy241</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy241/5122729?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Attention and saccadic adaptation (SA) are critical components of visual perception, the former enhancing sensory processing of selected objects, the latter maintaining the eye movements accuracy toward them. Recent studies propelled the hypothesis of a tight functional coupling between these mechanisms, possibly due to shared neural substrates. Here, we used magnetoencephalography to investigate for the first time the neurophysiological bases of this coupling and of SA per se. We compared visual discrimination performance of 12 healthy subjects before and after SA. Eye movements and magnetic signals were recorded continuously. Analyses focused on gamma band activity (GBA) during the pretarget period of the discrimination and the saccadic tasks. We found that GBA increases after SA. This increase was found in the right hemisphere for both postadaptation saccadic and discrimination tasks. For the latter, GBA also increased in the left hemisphere. We conclude that oculomotor plasticity involves GBA modulation within an extended neural network which persists after SA, suggesting a possible role of gamma oscillations in the coupling between SA and attention.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Representing Multiple Observed Actions in the Motor System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy237</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy237/5122730?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;There is now converging evidence that others’ actions are represented in the motor system. However, social cognition requires us to represent not only the actions but also the interactions of others. To do so, it is imperative that the motor system can represent multiple observed actions. The current fMRI study investigated whether this is possible by measuring brain activity from 29 participants while they observed 2 right hands performing sign language gestures. Three key results were obtained. First, brain activity in the premotor and parietal motor cortex was stronger when 2 hands performed 2 different gestures than when 1 hand performed a single gesture. Second, both individual observed gestures could be decoded from brain activity in the same 2 regions. Third, observing 2 different gestures compared with 2 identical gestures activated brain areas related to motor conflict, and this activity was correlated with parietal motor activity. Together, these results show that the motor system is able to represent multiple observed actions, and as such reveal a potential mechanism by which third-party social encounters could be processed in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Efficient Neural Coding in Auditory and Speech Perception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30246-7?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>Speech has long been recognized as ‘special’. Here, we suggest that one of the reasons for speech being special is that our auditory system has evolved to encode it in an efficient, optimal way. The theory of efficient neural coding argues that our perceptual systems have evolved to encode environmental stimuli in the most efficient way. Mathematically, this can be achieved if the optimally efficient codes match the statistics of the signals they represent. Experimental evidence suggests that the auditory code is optimal in this mathematical sense: statistical properties of speech closely match response properties of the cochlea, the auditory nerve, and the auditory cortex.</description>
