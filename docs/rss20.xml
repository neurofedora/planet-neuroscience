	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Minimax-optimal decoding of movement goals from local field potentials using complex spectral features. (arXiv:1901.10397v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10397</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider the problem of predicting eye movement goals from local field
potentials (LFP) recorded through a multielectrode array in the macaque
prefrontal cortex. The monkey is tasked with performing memory-guided saccades
to one of eight targets during which LFP activity is recorded and used to train
a decoder. Previous reports have mainly relied on the spectral amplitude of the
LFPs as a feature in the decoding step to limited success, while neglecting the
phase without proper theoretical justification. This paper formulates the
problem of decoding eye movement intentions in a statistically optimal
framework and uses Gaussian sequence modeling and Pinsker's theorem to generate
minimax-optimal estimates of the LFP signals which are later used as features
in the decoding step. The approach is shown to act as a low-pass filter and
each LFP in the feature space is represented via its complex Fourier
coefficients after appropriate shrinking such that higher frequency components
are attenuated; this way, the phase information inherently present in the LFP
signal is naturally embedded into the feature space. The proposed complex
spectrum-based decoder achieves prediction accuracy of up to $94\%$ at
superficial electrode depths near the surface of the prefrontal cortex, which
marks a significant performance improvement over conventional power
spectrum-based decoders.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Spectral Dynamic Causal Modelling of Resting-State fMRI: Relating Effective Brain Connectivity in the Default Mode Network to Genetics. (arXiv:1901.09975v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09975</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09975</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We conduct a novel imaging genetics study of the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative based on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and genetic data
obtained from 112 subjects, where each subject is classified as either
cognitively normal (CN), as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or as
having Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) is fit to the
rs-fMRI time series in order to estimate a directed network representing
effective brain connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), a key
network commonly known to be active when the brain is at rest. These networks
are then related to genetic data and Alzheimer's disease in the first
genome-wide association study to use DCM as a neuroimaging phenotype.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our proposed pipeline is comprised of four sequential analyses linked
together with the objective of shedding light on the relationship between brain
connectivity and genetics in relation to disease. In the first stage, we
examine differences in effective brain connectivity across disease groups. In
the second analysis we relate the probability of disease to genetics and obtain
a set of priority single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) potentially related to
disease. In the third analysis we investigate how effective brain connectivity
is related to the set of priority SNPs obtained in the second study. In the
fourth and final analysis we examine longitudinal data on changes with respect
to MCI and AD through a classifier in order to determine how well disease
progression can be predicted from the combination of effective brain
connectivity and genetic data. Our new pipeline for connectome genetics has
general applicability and its specific application to the ADNI study motivates
a number of future studies in this nascent area.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Surrogate Gradient Learning in Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:1901.09948v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09948</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09948</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A growing number of neuromorphic spiking neural network processors that
emulate biological neural networks create an imminent need for methods and
tools to enable them to solve real-world signal processing problems. Like
conventional neural networks, spiking neural networks are particularly
efficient when trained on real, domain specific data. However, their training
requires overcoming a number of challenges linked to their binary and dynamical
nature. This tutorial elucidates step-by-step the problems typically
encountered when training spiking neural networks, and guides the reader
through the key concepts of synaptic plasticity and data-driven learning in the
spiking setting. To that end, it gives an overview of existing approaches and
provides an introduction to surrogate gradient methods, specifically, as a
particularly flexible and efficient method to overcome the aforementioned
challenges.

	<description>Although chemotherapy is a conventional cancer treatment, it may induce a protumorigenic microenvironment by triggering the release of proinflammatory mediators.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: SLC13A3 variants cause acute reversible leukoencephalopathy and α‐ketoglutarate accumulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25412?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25412?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;SLC13A3&lt;/i&gt; encodes the plasma membrane Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/dicarboxylate cotransporter 3, which imports inside the cell 4 to 6 carbon dicarboxylates as well as N‐acetylaspartate (NAA). SLC13A3 is mainly expressed in kidney, in astrocytes, and in the choroid plexus. We describe two unrelated patients presenting with acute, reversible (and recurrent in one) neurological deterioration during a febrile illness. Both patients exhibited a reversible leukoencephalopathy and a urinary excretion of α‐ketoglutarate (αKG) that was markedly increased and persisted over time. In one patient, increased concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid NAA and dicarboxylates (including αKG) were observed. Extensive workup was unsuccessful, and a genetic cause was suspected.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed. Our teams were connected through GeneMatcher.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WES analysis revealed variants in &lt;i&gt;SLC13A3&lt;/i&gt;. A homozygous missense mutation (p.Ala254Asp) was found in the first patient. The second patient was heterozygous for another missense mutation (p.Gly548Ser) and an intronic mutation affecting splicing as demonstrated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction performed in muscle tissue (c.1016 + 3A &amp;gt; G). Mutations and segregation were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Functional studies performed on HEK293T cells transiently transfected with wild‐type and mutant SLC13A3 indicated that the missense mutations caused a marked reduction in the capacity to transport αKG, succinate, and NAA.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SLC13A3 deficiency causes acute and reversible leukoencephalopathy with marked accumulation of αKG. Urine organic acids (especially αKG and NAA) and &lt;i&gt;SLC13A3&lt;/i&gt; mutations should be screened in patients presenting with unexplained reversible leukoencephalopathy, for which SLC13A3 deficiency is a novel differential diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Estradiol-induced potentiation of dopamine release in dorsal striatum following amphetamine administration requires estradiol receptors and mGlu5</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Estradiol potentiates behavioral sensitization to cocaine as well as self-administration of cocaine and other drugs of abuse in female rodents. Furthermore, stimulated dopamine (DA) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is rapidly enhanced by estradiol, and it is hypothesized that this enhanced DA release mediates the more rapid escalation of drug taking seen in females, compared with males. The mechanisms mediating the effect of estradiol to enhance stimulated DA release was investigated in this study. Using in vivo microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection, we first examined the effect of estradiol on amphetamine-induced DA increase in the DLS of ovariectomized rats. We then tested if the potentiation of this DA increase could be blocked by the estradiol receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780 (ICI), or an antagonist to the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5), 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP). There is evidence that estradiol receptors collaborate with mGlu5 within caveoli in DLS and mGlu5 is hypothesized to mediate many of the effects of estradiol in the addiction processes in females. Our data show that estradiol enhances the DA response to amphetamine. Either ICI or MPEP prevented the effect of estradiol to enhance DA release. Importantly, our results also showed neither ICI or MPEP alone is able to influence the DA response to amphetamine when estradiol is not administrated, suggesting that ICI and MPEP act via estradiol receptors. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that estradiol potentiates amphetamine-stimulated DA release in the DLS and this effect requires both estradiol receptors and mGlu5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The present study provides important information on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the exacerbating effects of E2 on addictive behavior by showing blockage of E2 receptors or mGlu5 reduces E2-induced potentiation of DA release in the rat striatum following by amphetamine injections. Our data suggest targeting E2 receptors or mGluRs could have treatment potentials for E2-related disorders in areas such as, but not limited to, drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The primary sensory cortex processes competitive sensory inputs. Ablation of these competitive inputs induces neuroplastic changes in local cortical circuits. However, information concerning cortical plasticity induced by a disturbance of competitive nociceptive inputs is limited. Nociceptive information from the maxillary and mandibular molar pulps converges at the border between the ventral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and insular oral region (IOR); therefore, S2/IOR is a suitable target for examining the cortical changes induced by a disturbance of noxious inputs, which often causes neuropathic pain and allodynia. We focused on the plastic changes in S2/IOR excitation in a model of rats subjected to inferior alveolar nerve transection (IANX). Our optical imaging using a voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) revealed that the maxillary molar pulp stimulation-induced excitatory propagation was expanded one to two weeks after IANX at the macroscopic level. At the cellular level, based on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging using two-photon microscopy, the amplitude of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses and the number of responding neurons in S2/IOR increased in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) revealed that Layer II/III pyramidal and GABAergic fast-spiking neurons in S2/IOR received larger excitatory inputs from Layer IV in the IANX models, which supports the findings obtained by the macroscopic and microscopic optical imaging. Furthermore, the inhibitory postsynaptic inputs to the pyramidal neurons were decreased in the IANX models, suggesting suppression of inhibitory synaptic transmission onto excitatory neurons. These results suggest that IANX induces plastic changes in S2/IOR by changing the local excitatory and inhibitory circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Memory of a recently eaten meal can serve as a powerful mechanism for controlling future eating behavior because it provides a record of intake that likely outlasts most physiological signals generated by the meal. In support, impairing the encoding of a meal in humans increases the amount ingested at the next eating episode. However, the brain regions that mediate the inhibitory effects of memory on future intake are unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that dorsal hippocampal (dHC) and ventral hippocampal (vHC) glutamatergic pyramidal neurons play a critical role in the inhibition of energy intake during the postprandial period by optogenetically inhibiting these neurons at specific times relative to a meal. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given viral vectors containing CaMKIIα-eArchT3.0-eYFP or CaMKIIα-GFP and fiber optic probes into dHC of one hemisphere and vHC of the other. Compared to intake on a day in which illumination was not given, inhibition of dHC or vHC glutamatergic neurons after the end of a chow, sucrose, or saccharin meal accelerated the onset of the next meal and increased the amount consumed during that next meal when the neurons were no longer inhibited. Inhibition given during a meal did not affect the amount consumed during that meal or the next one but did hasten meal initiation. These data show that dHC and vHC glutamatergic neuronal activity during the postprandial period is critical for limiting subsequent ingestion and suggest that these neurons inhibit future intake by consolidating the memory of the preceding meal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) has long been implicated in the regulation of social behavior and communication, but precisely which AVP cell groups are involved is largely unknown. To address whether the sexually dimorphic AVP cell group in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for social communication, we deleted BNST AVP cells by viral delivery of a Cre-dependent caspase-3 cell-death construct in AVP-iCre-positive mice using AVP-iCre negative littermate as controls, and assessed social, sexual, aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. In males, lesioning BNST AVP cells reduced social investigation of other males and increased urine marking (UM) in the presence of a live female, without altering ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), resident-intruder aggression, copulatory behavior, anxiety, or investigation of females or their odor cues. In females, which have significantly fewer AVP cells in the BNST, these injections influenced copulatory behavior but otherwise had minimal effects on social behavior and communication, indicating that these cells contribute to sex differences in social behavioral function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Preclinical and clinical research has shown that females are more vulnerable to the rewarding effects of stimulants, and it has been proposed that estrogens may play a role in this enhanced sensitivity; however sex differences in methamphetamine (METH)-induced neuroplasticity have not been explored. To address this gap in knowledge, we recorded from the prelimbic area of the prefrontal cortex (PL-PFC) of male and female rats following long access METH self-administration (SA) and investigated the resulting long-term synaptic neuroadaptations. Males and females took similar amounts of METH during SA; however, female rats exhibit significant synaptic baseline differences when compared to males. Furthermore, females exhibited a significant increase in evoked excitatory currents. This increase in evoked glutamate was correlated with increases in NMDA currents and was not affected by application of a GluN2B selective blocker. We propose that METH SA selectively upregulates GluN2B-lacking NMDA receptors (NMDAR) in the PFC of female rats. Our results may provide a mechanistic explanation for the sex differences reported for METH addiction in females.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Activity Patterns in the Neuropil of Striatal Cholinergic Interneurons in Freely Moving Mice Represent Their Collective Spiking Dynamics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are believed to form synchronous cell assemblies that modulate the striatal microcircuitry and possibly orchestrate local dopamine release. We expressed GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECIs), selectively in CINs, and used microendoscopes to visualize the putative CIN assemblies in the dorsal striatum of freely moving mice. The GECI fluorescence signal from the dorsal striatum was composed of signals from individual CIN somata that were engulfed by a widespread fluorescent neuropil. Bouts of synchronous activation of the cholinergic neuropil revealed patterns of activity that preceded the signal from individual somata. To investigate the nature of the neuropil signal and why it precedes the somatic signal, we target-patched GECI-expressing CINs in acute striatal slices in conjunction with multiphoton imaging or wide-field imaging that emulates the microendoscopes’ specifications. The ability to detect fluorescent transients associated with individual action potential was constrained by the long decay constant of GECIs (relative to common inorganic dyes) to slowly firing (&amp;lt;2 spikes/s) CINs. The microendoscopes’ resolving power and sampling rate further diminished this ability. Additionally, we found that only back-propagating action potentials but not synchronous optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs elicited observable calcium transients in CIN dendrites. Our data suggest that only bursts of CIN activity (but not their tonic firing) are visible using endoscopic imaging, and that the neuropil patterns are a physiological measure of the collective recurrent CIN network spiking activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Large normal alleles of ATXN2 decrease age at onset in transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy Val30Met patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25409?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transthyretin (TTR)‐related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in &lt;i&gt;TTR&lt;/i&gt;. Age at onset (AO) ranges from 19 to 82 years, and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of 10 genes had a possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR‐FAP Val30Met families.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed 329 Portuguese patients from 123 families. Repeat length (at &lt;i&gt;ATXN1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATXN7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TBP, ATN1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;JPH3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;DMPK&lt;/i&gt;) was assessed by single and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescently labeled primers, followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family‐centered approach, and generalized estimating equations were used to account for AO correlation between family members.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt;, the presence of at least 1 allele longer than 22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR‐FAP Val30Met, decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% confidence interval = −8.81 to −2.19, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat loci.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Length of normal repeats at &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt; may modify AO in TTR‐FAP Val30Met and may function as a risk factor. This can be due to the role of &lt;i&gt;ATXN2&lt;/i&gt; in RNA metabolism and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases risk of dementia, a relationship that may be mediated by amyloid‐β (Aβ) and downstream Alzheimer disease pathology. We previously showed that OSA may impair Aβ clearance and affect the relationship between slow wave activity (SWA) and Aβ. In this study, SWA and CSF Aβ were measured in participants with OSA before and 1 to 4 months after treatment. OSA treatment increased SWA, and SWA was significantly correlated with lower Aβ after treatment. Greater improvement in OSA was associated with greater decreases in Aβ. We propose a model whereby OSA treatment may affect both Aβ release and clearance. Ann Neurol 2018 &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:291–295.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid‐β transmission has been described in patients both with and without iatrogenic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease; however, there is little information regarding the clinical impact of this acquired amyloid‐β pathology during life. Here, for the first time, we describe in detail the clinical and neuroimaging findings in 3 patients with early onset symptomatic amyloid‐β cerebral amyloid angiopathy following childhood exposure to cadaveric dura (by neurosurgical grafting in 2 patients and tumor embolization in a third). Our observations provide further in vivo evidence that cerebral amyloid angiopathy might be caused by transmission of amyloid‐β seeds (prions) present in cadaveric dura and have diagnostic relevance for younger patients presenting with suspected cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the rate of tau accumulation in healthy older adults (OA) and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), as well as the relationship of tau accumulation to cortical atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two longitudinal flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 42 OA (21 Pittsburg compound B [PiB]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, age = 77.6 ± 4.6 years, 25 female [F]/17 male [M]) and 19 PiB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; patients with AD (age = 63.1 ± 10.3 years, 12 F/7 M) over 1 to 3 years of follow‐up. FTP change, structural MRI measures of atrophy, and cross‐modal correlations were examined on a voxelwise level. Regional annual percentage change in FTP was also calculated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voxelwise FTP change in AD showed the greatest increases in lateral and medial frontal lobes. Atrophy over the same interval was more widespread and included posteromedial cortical areas, where tau accumulation rates were lower. In OA, FTP binding increased in bilateral temporal lobe and retrosplenial cortex, accompanied by atrophy in the same regions. There were no associations between voxelwise change in FTP and sex, PiB, or &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;. Regional FTP significantly increased at follow‐up in OA and patients with AD. Mixed effects models showed greater FTP increases in AD compared to OA, and no differences within OA based on PiB status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that tau accumulates even in amyloid‐negative healthy OA and this process can be measured with in vivo tau‐PET. In OA, tau accumulation and atrophy share a similar topography. In AD, tau increases more rapidly and accumulation occurs in frontal regions that are not yet undergoing significant atrophy.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Metabolic patterns and seizure outcomes following anterior temporal lobectomy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25405?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the relationship between the interictal metabolic patterns, the extent of resection of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;FDG‐PET) hypometabolism, and seizure outcomes in patients with unilateral drug‐resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) following anterior temporal lobe (TL) resection.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty‐two patients with hippocampal sclerosis or normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, concordant &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;FDG‐PET hypometabolism, and at least 2 years of postoperative follow‐up were included in this 2‐center study. The hypometabolic regions in each patient were identified with reference to 20 healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005). The resected TL volume and the volume of resected TL PET hypometabolism (TLH) were calculated from the pre‐ and postoperative MRI scans coregistered with interictal &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;FDG‐PET.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Striking differences in metabolic patterns were observed depending on the lateralization of the epileptogenic TL. The extent of the ipsilateral TLH was significantly greater in left MTLE patients &lt;i&gt;(p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), whereas right MTLE patients had significantly higher rates of contralateral (CTL) TLH (&lt;i&gt;p =&lt;/i&gt; 0.016). In right MTLE patients, CTL hypometabolism was the strongest predictor of an unfavorable seizure outcome, associated with a 5‐fold increase in the likelihood of seizure recurrence (odds ratio [OR] = 4.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07–22.39, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). In left MTLE patients, greater extent of resection of ipsilateral TLH was associated with lower rates of seizure recurrence (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004) in univariate analysis; however, its predictive value did not reach statistical significance (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.90–1.02, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.19).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in metabolic patterns depending on the lateralization of MTLE may represent distinct epileptic networks in patients with right versus left MTLE, and can guide preoperative counseling and surgical planning.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: In vivo metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 abnormalities localize the epileptogenic zone in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25404?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical specimens from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) show abnormalities in tissue concentrations of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5). To clarify whether these abnormalities are specific to the epileptogenic zone (EZ), we characterized in vivo whole‐brain mGluR5 availability in MTLE patients using positron emission tomography (PET) and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688, a radioligand that binds specifically to the mGluR5 allosteric site.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐one unilateral MTLE patients and 30 healthy controls underwent [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 PET. We compared partial volume corrected [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 nondisplaceable binding potentials (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;) between groups using region‐of‐interest and whole‐brain voxelwise analyses. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET was acquired in 15 patients, for whom we calculated asymmetry indices of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake to compare lateralization and localization differences.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; was focally reduced in the epileptogenic hippocampal head and amygdala (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Patients with hippocampal atrophy showed more extensive abnormalities, including the ipsilateral temporal neocortex (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006). [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; showed interhemispheric differences of higher magnitude and discriminated the epileptogenic structures more accurately when compared to [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake, which showed more widespread hypometabolism. Among 23 of 25 operated patients with &amp;gt;1 year of follow‐up, 13 were seizure‐free (Engel Ia) and showed significantly lower [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; in the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 PET provides a focal biomarker for the EZ in MTLE with higher spatial accuracy compared to [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG PET. Focally reduced mGluR5 availability in the EZ might reflect receptor internalization or conformational changes in response to excessive extracellular glutamate, supporting a potential role for mGluR5 as therapeutic target in human MTLE.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Gamma‐aminobutyric acidergic transmission underlies interictal epileptogenicity in pediatric focal cortical dysplasia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25403?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25403?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of γ‐aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) transmission has been reported in lesional acquired epilepsies (gliomas, hippocampal sclerosis). We investigated its involvement in a developmental disorder, human focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), focusing on chloride regulation driving GABAergic signals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vitro recordings of 47 human cortical acute slices from 11 pediatric patients who received operations for FCD were performed on multielectrode arrays. GABAergic receptors and chloride regulators were pharmacologically modulated. Immunostaining for chloride cotransporter KCC2 and interneurons were performed on recorded slices to correlate electrophysiology and expression patterns.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FCD slices retain intrinsic epileptogenicity. Thirty‐six of 47 slices displayed spontaneous interictal discharges, along with a pattern specific to the histological subtypes. Ictal discharges were induced in proepileptic conditions in 6 of 8 slices in the areas generating spontaneous interictal discharges, with a transition to seizure involving the emergence of preictal discharges. Interictal discharges were sustained by GABAergic signaling, as a GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor blocker stopped them in 2 of 3 slices. Blockade of NKCC1 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cotransporters further controlled interictal discharges in 9 of 12 cases, revealing a Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; dysregulation affecting actions of GABA. Immunohistochemistry highlighted decreased expression and changes in KCC2 subcellular localization and a decrease in the number of GAD67‐positive interneurons in regions generating interictal discharges.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altered chloride cotransporter expression and changes in interneuron density in FCD may lead to paradoxical depolarization of pyramidal cells. Spontaneous interictal discharges are consequently mediated by GABAergic signals, and targeting chloride regulation in neurons may be considered for the development of new antiepileptic drugs.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology frequently co‐occur in older adults. The extent to which cerebrovascular disease influences the progression of AD pathology remains unclear. Leveraging newly available positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we examined whether a well‐validated measure of systemic vascular risk and &lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;‐amyloid (A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;) burden have an interactive association with regional tau burden.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular risk was quantified at baseline in 152 clinically normal older adults (mean age = 73.5 ± 6.1 years) with the office‐based Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (FHS‐CVD). We acquired A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C‐Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐flortaucipir) PET imaging on the same participants. A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; PET was performed at baseline; tau PET was acquired on average 2.98 ± 1.1 years later. Tau was measured in the entorhinal cortex (EC), an early site of tau deposition, and in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), an early site of neocortical tau accumulation associated with AD. Linear regression models examined FHS‐CVD and A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; as interactive predictors of tau deposition, adjusting for age, sex, &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; ε4 status, and the time interval between baseline and the tau PET scan.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed a significant interaction between FHS‐CVD and A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; burden on subsequently measured ITC tau (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), whereby combined higher FHS‐CVD and elevated A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; burden was associated with increased tau. The interaction was not significant for EC tau (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.16).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elevated vascular risk may influence tau burden when coupled with high A&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt; burden. These results suggest a potential link between vascular risk and tau pathology in preclinical AD. Ann Neurol 2019; 1–8 &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:272–279.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigated changes of after‐image duration in migraineurs and healthy controls (HCs) and throughout the migraine cycle to depict changes in the excitatory/inhibitory equilibrium within the visual cortex. Forty‐seven episodic (EMs) and 39 chronic migraineurs (CMs; interictal) were compared to 34 HCs for visual after‐image duration. Additionally, seven EMs were investigated every consecutive day over 20 to 32 days using the identical paradigm throughout the migraine cycle. Interictally, the after‐image duration was shorter compared to HCs, but significantly longer in the ictal compared to interictal phase. These data suggest an altered excitatory/inhibitory equilibrium in migraineurs, which oscillates over the migraine cycle. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:280–283.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Visceral obesity relates to deep white matter hyperintensities via inflammation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25396?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25396?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are linked to vascular risk factors and increase the risk of cognitive decline, dementia, and stroke. We here aimed to determine whether obesity contributes to regional WMHs using a whole‐brain approach in a well‐characterized population‐based cohort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waist‐to‐hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI), systolic/diastolic blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes and smoking status, blood glucose and inflammatory markers, as well as distribution of WMH were assessed in 1,825 participants of the LIFE‐adult study (age, 20–82 years; BMI, 18.4–55.4 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) using high‐resolution 3‐Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel‐wise analyses tested if obesity predicts regional probability of WMH. Additionally, mediation effects of high‐sensitive C‐reactive protein and interleukin‐6 (IL6) measured in blood were related to obesity and WMH using linear regression and structural equation models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHR related to higher WMH probability predominantly in the deep white matter, even after adjusting for effects of age, sex, and systolic blood pressure (mean ß = 0.0043 [0.0008 SE], 95% confidence interval, [0.00427, 0.0043]; threshold‐free cluster enhancement, family‐wise error‐corrected &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Conversely, higher systolic blood pressure was associated with WMH in periventricular white matter regions. Mediation analyses indicated that both higher WHR and higher BMI contributed to increased deep‐to‐periventricular WMH ratio through elevated IL6.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate an increased WMH burden selectively in the deep white matter in obese subjects with high visceral fat accumulation, independent of common obesity comorbidities such as hypertension. Mediation analyses proposed that visceral obesity contributes to deep white matter lesions through increases in proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting a pathomechanistic link. Longitudinal studies need to confirm this hypothesis. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:194–203.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: The impact of amyloid‐beta and tau on prospective cognitive decline in older individuals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25395?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25395?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid‐beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies are commonly observed among clinically normal older individuals at postmortem and can now be detected with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; neuroimaging. The association and interaction of these proteinopathies with prospective cognitive decline in normal aging and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains to be fully elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred thirty‐seven older individuals (age = 76.3 ± 6.22 years) participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study underwent Aβ (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C‐Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐flortaucipir) positron emission tomography (PET) with prospective neuropsychological assessments following PET imaging (mean number of cognitive visits = 2.8 ± 1.1). Tau and Aβ PET measures were assessed in regions of interest (ROIs) as well as vertex‐wise map analyses. Cognitive change was evaluated with Memory and Executive Function composites.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of Aβ and tau were both associated with greater memory decline, but not with change in executive function. Higher cortical Aβ was associated with higher tau levels in all ROIs, independent of age, and very elevated levels of tau were observed primarily in clinically normal with elevated Aβ. A significant interaction between tau and Aβ was observed in both ROI and map‐level analyses, such that rapid prospective memory decline was observed in participants who had high levels of both pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results are consistent with the supposition that both Aβ and tau are necessary for memory decline in the preclinical stages of AD. These findings may be relevant for disambiguating aging and early cognitive manifestations of AD, and to inform secondary prevention trials in preclinical AD.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variant ataxia‐telangiectasia is caused by mutations that allow some retained ataxia telangiectasia‐mutated (ATM) kinase activity. Here, we describe the clinical features of the largest established cohort of individuals with variant ataxia‐telangiectasia and explore genotype‐phenotype correlations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross‐sectional data were collected retrospectively. Patients were classified as variant ataxia‐telangiectasia based on retained ATM kinase activity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study includes 57 individuals. Mean age at assessment was 37.5 years. Most had their first symptoms by age 10 (81%). There was a diagnostic delay of more than 10 years in 68% and more than 20 years in one third of probands. Disease severity was mild in one third of patients, and 43% were still ambulant 20 years after disease onset. Only one third had predominant ataxia, and 18% had a pure extrapyramidal presentation. Individuals with extrapyramidal presentations had milder neurological disease severity. There were no significant respiratory or immunological complications, but 25% of individuals had a history of malignancy. Missense mutations were associated with milder neurological disease severity, but with a higher risk of malignancy, compared to leaky splice site mutations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals with variant ataxia‐telangiectasia require malignancy surveillance and tailored management. However, our data suggest the condition may sometimes be mis‐ or underdiagnosed because of atypical features, including exclusive extrapyramidal symptoms, normal eye movements, and normal alpha‐fetoprotein levels in some individuals. Missense mutations are associated with milder neurological presentations, but a particularly high malignancy risk, and it is important for clinicians to be aware of these phenotypes. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:170–180.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Easily accessible biomarkers in Huntington disease (HD) are actively searched. We investigated telomere length and DNA double‐strand breaks (histone variant pγ‐H2AX) as predictive disease biomarkers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 25 premanifest subjects, 58 HD patients with similar CAG expansion in the huntingtin gene (&lt;i&gt;HTT&lt;/i&gt;), and 44 healthy controls (HC). PBMC from the pre‐HD and HD groups showed shorter telomeres (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and a significant increase of pγ‐H2AX compared to the controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). The levels of pγ‐H2AX correlated robustly with the presence of the mutated gene in pre‐HD and HD. The availability of a potentially reversible biomarker (pγ‐H2AX) in the premanifest stage of HD, negligible in HC, provides a novel tool to monitor premanifest subjects and find patient‐specific drugs.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Cognitive and Pathological Influences of Tau Pathology in Lewy Body Disorders</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use digital histology in a large autopsy cohort of Lewy body disorder (LBD) patients with dementia to test the hypotheses that co‐occurring Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology impacts the anatomic distribution of α‐synuclein (SYN) pathology and that co‐occurring neocortical tau pathology in LBDs associates with worse cognitive performance and occurs in a pattern differing from AD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty‐five autopsy‐confirmed LBD (Parkinson disease with dementia, n = 36; dementia with Lewy bodies, n = 19) patients and 25 AD patients were studied. LBD patients were categorized as having moderate/severe AD copathology (SYN + AD = 20) or little/no AD copathology (SYN−AD = 35). Digital measures of tau, β‐amyloid (Aβ), and SYN histopathology in neocortical and subcortical/limbic regions were compared between groups and related to antemortem cognitive testing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SYN burden was higher in SYN + AD than SYN−AD in each neocortical region (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1, 54&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.6–6.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.02) but was equivalent in entorhinal cortex and putamen (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1, 43–49&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.7–1.7, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.2). SYN + AD performed worse than SYN−AD on a temporal lobe–mediated naming task (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). Antemortem cognitive test scores inversely correlated with tau burden (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = −0.39 to −0.68, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). AD had higher tau than SYN + AD in all regions (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1, 43&lt;/sub&gt; = 12.8–97.2, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001); however, SYN + AD had a greater proportion of tau in the temporal neocortex than AD (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), whereas AD had a greater proportion of tau in the frontal neocortex than SYN + AD (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.002). SYN + AD had similar severity and distribution of neocortical Aβ compared to AD (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1, 40–43&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.6–2.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.1).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LBD patients with AD copathology harbor greater neocortical SYN pathology. Regional tau pathology relates to cognitive performance in LBD dementia, and its distribution may diverge from pure AD. Tau copathology contributes uniquely to the heterogeneity of cognitive impairment in LBD. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–13 &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:259–271.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: A Randomized Study of Solriamfetol for Excessive Sleepiness in Narcolepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25423?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solriamfetol (JZP‐110) is a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with wake‐promoting effects. This phase 3 study (NCT02348593) evaluated the safety and efficacy of solriamfetol in narcolepsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with narcolepsy with mean sleep latency &amp;lt;25 minutes on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score ≥10, and usual nightly sleep ≥6 hours were randomized to solriamfetol 75, 150, or 300 mg, or placebo for 12 weeks. Co‐primary endpoints were change from baseline to Week 12 in MWT and ESS. Improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI‐C) was the key secondary endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety and modified intention‐to‐treat populations included 236 and 231 patients. Solriamfetol 300 and 150 mg were positive on both co‐primary endpoints. Least squares mean (standard error [SE]) changes from baseline were 12.3 (SE = 1.4) and 9.8 (SE = 1.3) minutes for solriamfetol 300 and 150 mg on the MWT, respectively, versus 2.1 (SE = 1.3) minutes for placebo, and –6.4 (SE = 0.7) for 300 mg and –5.4 (SE = 0.7) for 150 mg on the ESS versus –1.6 (SE = 0.7) for placebo (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). At Week 12, higher percentages of patients treated with solriamfetol 150 mg (78.2%) and 300 mg (84.7%) reported PGI‐C improvement relative to placebo (39.7%; both &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Adverse events ≥5% across all solriamfetol doses included headache (21.5%), nausea (10.7%), decreased appetite (10.7%), nasopharyngitis (9.0%), dry mouth (7.3%), and anxiety (5.1%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solriamfetol has the potential to be an important therapeutic option for the treatment of impaired wakefulness and excessive sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy.&lt;/p&gt;

Cell-specific alternative splicing programs coordinate exon selection across networks of functionally connected genes. In this opinion piece, we highlight recent publications that identify some of the molecular mechanisms—RNA and DNA binding proteins and epigenetic modifications—which direct cell-specific exon selection during pre-mRNA splicing. Aberrant splicing patterns are signature features of a growing number of diseases of the nervous system. Recent publications demonstrate the value of delineating basic mechanisms that dictate exon choice to inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that correct or compensate for damaging deficits in alternative splicing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

While numerically much simpler than mammalian brains, its complexity is still difficult to parse without grouping neurons into consistent types, which can number 1–1000 cells per hemisphere. We review how neuroanatomical and gene expression data are being used to discover neuronal types at scale. The correlation among multiple co-varying neuronal properties, including lineage, gene expression, morphology, connectivity, response properties and shared behavioral significance is essential to the definition of neuronal cell type. Initial studies comparing morphological and transcriptomic definitions of neuronal type suggest that these are highly consistent, but there is much to do to match these approaches brain-wide. Matched single-cell transcriptomic and morphological data provide an effective reference point to integrate other data types, including connectomics data. This will significantly enhance our ability to make functional predictions from brain wiring diagrams as well facilitating molecular genetic manipulation of neuronal types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Neuroblast-specific chromatin landscapes allows the integration of spatial and temporal cues during Drosophila neurogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.44036</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/44036</link>
	<description>Spatial and temporal cues are required to specify neuronal diversity, but how these cues are integrated in neural progenitors remains unknown. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; progenitors (neuroblasts) are a good model: they are individually identifiable with relevant spatial and temporal transcription factors known. Here we test whether spatial/temporal factors act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts. We used Targeted-DamID to identify genomic binding sites of the Hunchback temporal factor in two neuroblasts (NB5-6 and NB7-4) that make different progeny. Hunchback targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent specification model. Moreover, each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast. Importantly, Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor binding correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4. Our data support a model in which early-acting spatial factors establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A systematic approach to identify recycling endocytic cargo depending on the GARP complex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.42837</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42837</link>
	<description>Proteins and lipids of the plasma membrane underlie constant remodeling via a combination of the secretory- and the endocytic pathway. In the yeast endocytic pathway, cargo is sorted for recycling to the plasma membrane or degradation in vacuoles. Previously we have shown a role for the GARP complex in sphingolipid sorting and homeostasis (Fröhlich et al. 2015). However, the majority of cargo sorted in a GARP dependent process remain largely unknown. Here we use auxin induced degradation of GARP combined with mass spectrometry based vacuolar proteomics and lipidomics to show that recycling of two specific groups of proteins, the amino-phospholipid flippases and cell wall synthesis proteins depends on a functional GARP complex. Our results suggest that mis-sorting of flippases and remodeling of the lipid composition are the first occurring defects in GARP mutants. Our assay can be adapted to systematically map cargo of the entire endocytic pathway.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Incidences of problematic cell lines are lower in papers that use RRIDs to identify cell lines</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.41676</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41676</link>
	<description>The use of misidentified and contaminated cell lines continues to be a problem in biomedical research. Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) should reduce the prevalence of misidentified and contaminated cell lines in the literature by alerting researchers to cell lines that are on the list of problematic cell lines, which is maintained by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) and the Cellosaurus database. To test this assertion, we text-mined the methods sections of about two million papers in PubMed Central, identifying 305,161 unique cell-line names in 150,459 articles. We estimate that 8.6% of these cell lines were on the list of problematic cell lines, whereas only 3.3% of the cell lines in the 634 papers that included RRIDs were on the problematic list. This suggests that the use of RRIDs is associated with a lower reported use of problematic cell lines.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Mi-2/NuRD complex protects stem cell progeny from mitogenic Notch signalling</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41637</link>
	<description>To progress towards differentiation, progeny of stem cells need to extinguish expression of stem cell maintenance genes. Failures in such mechanisms can drive tumorigenesis. In Drosophila neural stem cell (NSC) lineages, excessive Notch signalling results in supernumerary NSCs causing hyperplasia. However, onset of hyperplasia is considerably delayed implying there are mechanisms that resist the mitogenic signal. Monitoring the live expression of a Notch target gene, &lt;i&gt;E(spl)mγ&lt;/i&gt;, revealed that normal attenuation is still initiated in the presence of excess Notch activity so that re-emergence of NSC properties occurs only in older progeny. Screening for factors responsible, we found that depletion of Mi-2/NuRD ATP remodeling complex dramatically enhanced Notch-induced hyperplasia. Under these conditions, &lt;i&gt;E(spl)mγ &lt;/i&gt;was no longer extinguished in NSC progeny. We propose that Mi-2 is required for decommissioning stem cell enhancers in their progeny, enabling the switch towards more differentiated fates and rendering them insensitive to mitogenic factors such as Notch.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: In Vivo imaging of β-cell function reveals glucose-mediated heterogeneity of β-cell functional development</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41540</link>
	<description>How pancreatic β-cells acquire function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; is a long-standing mystery due to the lack of technology to visualize β-cell function in living animals. Here, we applied a high-resolution two-photon light-sheet microscope for the first &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity of every β-cell in Tg (&lt;i&gt;ins:Rcamp1.07&lt;/i&gt;) zebrafish. We reveal that the heterogeneity of β-cell functional development &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; occurred as two waves propagating from the islet mantle to the core, coordinated by islet vascularization. Increasing amounts of glucose induced functional acquisition and enhancement of β-cells via activating calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signalling. Conserved in mammalians, calcineurin/NFAT prompted high-glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of neonatal mouse islets cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. However, the reduction in low-glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was dependent on optimal glucose but independent of calcineurin/NFAT. Thus, combination of optimal glucose and calcineurin activation represents a previously unexplored strategy for promoting functional maturation of stem cell-derived β-like cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Mitochondrial fusion supports increased oxidative phosphorylation during cell proliferation</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41351</link>
	<description>Proliferating cells often have increased glucose consumption and lactate excretion relative to the same cells in the quiescent state, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. Despite an increase in glycolysis, however, here we show that non-transformed mouse fibroblasts also increase oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by nearly two-fold and mitochondrial coupling efficiency by ~30% during proliferation. Both increases are supported by mitochondrial fusion. Impairing mitochondrial fusion by knocking down mitofusion-2 (Mfn2) was sufficient to attenuate proliferation, while overexpressing Mfn2 increased proliferation. Interestingly, impairing mitochondrial fusion decreased OXPHOS but did not deplete ATP levels. Instead, inhibition caused cells to transition from excreting aspartate to consuming it. Transforming fibroblasts with the &lt;i&gt;Ras&lt;/i&gt; oncogene induced mitochondrial biogenesis, which further elevated OXPHOS. Notably, transformed fibroblasts continued to have elongated mitochondria and their proliferation remained sensitive to inhibition of Mfn2. Our results suggest that cell proliferation requires increased OXPHOS as supported by mitochondrial fusion.</description>

	<description>Leptin regulates energy balance and also exhibits neurotrophic effects during critical developmental periods. However, the actual role of leptin during development is not yet fully understood. To uncover the importance of leptin in early life, the present study restored leptin signaling either at the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; week of age in mice formerly null for the leptin receptor (LepR) gene. We found that some defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling, including the poor development of arcuate nucleus neural projections, were recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood. However, LepR deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. LepR reactivation in adulthood also led to persistent reduction in hypothalamic &lt;i&gt;Pomc&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cartpt&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Prlh&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression and to defects in the reproductive system and brain growth. Our findings revealed that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine and developmental problems.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Potentiation of P2RX7 as a host-directed strategy for control of mycobacterial infection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.39123</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39123</link>
	<description>&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; is the leading worldwide cause of death due to a single infectious agent. Existing anti-tuberculous therapies require long treatments and are complicated by multi-drug-resistant strains. Host-directed therapies have been proposed as an orthogonal approach, but few have moved into clinical trials. Here, we use the zebrafish-&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium marinum&lt;/i&gt; infection model as a whole-animal screening platform to identify FDA-approved, host-directed compounds. We identify multiple compounds that modulate host immunity to limit mycobacterial disease, including the inexpensive, safe, and widely used drug clemastine. We find that clemastine alters macrophage calcium transients through potentiation of the purinergic receptor P2RX7. Host-directed drug activity in zebrafish larvae depends on both P2RX7 and inflammasome signaling. Thus, targeted activation of a P2RX7 axis provides a novel strategy for enhanced control of mycobacterial infections. Using a novel explant model, we find that clemastine is also effective within the complex granulomas that are the hallmark of mycobacterial infection.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: TIAM-1/GEF can shape somatosensory dendrites independently of its GEF activity by regulating F-actin localization</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38949</link>
	<description>Dendritic arbors are a crucial for nervous system assembly, but the intracellular mechanisms that govern their assembly remain incompletely understood. Here we show that the dendrites of PVD neurons in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans &lt;/i&gt;are patterned by distinct pathways downstream of the DMA-1 leucine rich transmembrane (LRR-TM) receptor. DMA-1/LRR-TM interacts through a PDZ ligand motif with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor TIAM-1/GEF in a complex with &lt;i&gt;act-4/Actin&lt;/i&gt; to pattern higher order 4º dendrite branches by localizing F-actin to the distal ends of developing dendrites. Surprisingly, TIAM-1/GEF appears to function independently of Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity. A partially redundant pathway, dependent on HPO-30/Claudin, regulates formation of 2º and 3º branches, possibly by regulating membrane localization and trafficking of DMA-1/LRR-TM. Collectively, our experiments suggest that HPO-30/Claudin localizes the DMA-1/LRR-TM receptor on PVD dendrites, which in turn can control dendrite patterning by directly modulating F-actin dynamics through TIAM-1/GEF.</description>

	<description>Perception of vocalizations and other behaviorally relevant sounds requires integrating acoustic information over hundreds of milliseconds, but the latency of sound-evoked activity in auditory cortex typically has much shorter latency. It has been observed that the acoustic context, i.e., sound history, can modulate sound evoked activity. Contextual effects are attributed to modulatory phenomena, such as stimulus-specific adaption and contrast gain control. However, an encoding model that links context to natural sound processing has yet to be established. We tested whether a model in which spectrally tuned inputs undergo adaptation mimicking short-term synaptic plasticity can account for contextual effects during natural sound processing. Single-unit activity was recorded from primary auditory cortex of awake ferrets during presentation of noise with natural temporal dynamics and fully natural sounds. Encoding properties were characterized by a standard linear-nonlinear spectro-temporal receptive field model (LN STRF) and STRF variants that incorporated STP-like adaptation. In two models, STP was applied either globally across all spectral channels or locally to subsets of channels. For most neurons, STRFs incorporating locally tuned STP predicted neural activity as well or better than the LN and global STP STRF. The strength of nonlinear adaptation varied across neurons. Within neurons, adaptation was generally stronger for activation with excitatory than inhibitory gain. Neurons showing improved STP model performance also tended to undergo stimulus-specific adaptation, suggesting a common mechanism for these phenomena. When STP STRFs were compared between passive and active behavior conditions, response gain often changed, but average STP parameters were stable. Thus, spectrally and temporally heterogeneous adaptation, subserved by a mechanism with STP-like dynamics, may support representation of the diverse spectro-temporal patterns that comprise natural sounds.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Characteristics of Beta Waveform Shape in Parkinson\'s Disease Detected with Scalp Electroencephalography</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/534396v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Neural activity in the beta frequency range (13-30 Hz) is excessively synchronized in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Previous work using invasive intracranial recordings and non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has shown that correlations between beta phase and broadband gamma amplitude (i.e., phase-amplitude coupling) are elevated in PD, perhaps a reflection of this synchrony. Recently, it has also been shown, in invasive human recordings, that nonsinusoidal features of beta oscillation shape also characterize PD. Here we show that these features of beta waveform shape also distinguish PD patients on and off medication using non-invasive recordings in a dataset of 15 PD patients with resting scalp EEG. Specifically, beta oscillations over sensorimotor electrodes in PD patients off medication had greater sharpness asymmetry and steepness asymmetry than on medication (sign rank, p=0.006, p=0.003 respectively). We also showed that beta oscillations over sensorimotor cortex most often had a canonical shape and that using this prototypical shape as an inclusion criterion increased the effect size of our findings. Together our findings suggest that novel ways of measuring beta synchrony which incorporate waveform shape could improve detection of PD pathophysiology in non-invasive recordings.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Chemogenetic inhibition of the amygdala modulates emotional behavior expression in infant rhesus monkeys</title>

	<description>Manipulation of neuronal activity during the early postnatal period in monkeys has been largely limited to permanent lesion studies, which can be impacted by developmental plasticity leading to reorganization and compensation from other brain structures that can interfere with the interpretations of results. Chemogenetic tools, such as DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), can transiently and reversibly activate or inactivate brain structures, avoiding the pitfalls of permanent lesions to better address important developmental neuroscience questions. We demonstrate that inhibitory DREADDs in the amygdala can be used to manipulate socioemotional behavior in infant monkeys. Two infant rhesus monkeys (1 male, 1 female) received AAV5-hSyn-HA-hM4Di-IRES-mCitrine injections bilaterally in the amygdala at 9 months of age. DREADD activation after systemic administration of either clozapine-N-oxide or low dose clozapine resulted in decreased freezing and anxiety on the human intruder paradigm and changed the looking patterns on a socioemotional attention eyetracking task, compared to vehicle administration. The DREADD-induced behaviors were reminiscent of, but not identical to, those seen after permanent lesions of the amygdala in infant monkeys, such that early amygdala lesions produce a more extensive array of behavioral changes in response to the human intruder task that were not seen with DREADD-evoked inhibition of this region. Our results support the notion that early permanent damage leads to brain reorganization manifesting in a broader impact on behavior. The current study provides a proof-of-principle that DREADDs can be used in young infant monkeys to transiently and reversibly manipulate behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Fear in dreams and in wakefulness: evidence for day/night affective homeostasis</title>

	<description>Despite partial experimental evidence, it is a long-standing and common belief that dreams serve an emotion regulation function. Revisiting this idea, recent neuroscientific theories have proposed that emotions experienced in dreams contribute to the resolution of emotional distress (e.g. fear extinction) and preparation for future waking affective reactions. Here we addressed one emerging common prediction from these theoretical accounts, namely that experiencing fear in dreams is associated with more adapted responses to threatening signals during wakefulness. Using a stepwise approach across two studies, we first identified brain regions activated when experiencing fear in dreams and then showed that frightening dreams modulated the response of these same regions to threatening stimuli during wakefulness. As predicted, more fear in dreams was associated with reduced activation of those fear-responsive regions during wakefulness. Specifically, in Study 1, we performed serial awakenings in 18 participants recorded throughout the night with high-density EEG and asked them whether they experienced any fear in their dreams. Insula activity increased (i.e. decreased delta and increased gamma power) for dreams containing fear. In Study 2, we tested 89 participants and found that those with higher incidence of fear in their dreams showed reduced fMRI response to fear-eliciting stimuli in the insula, amygdala and midcingulate cortex, while awake. Consistent with better emotion regulation processes, the same participants also displayed increased medial prefrontal cortex activity. These findings support that emotions in dreams and wakefulness engage similar neural substrates, and substantiate a link between emotional processes occurring during sleep and emotional brain functions during wakefulness.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Differential effects of open- and closed-loop intracortical microstimulation on firing patterns of neurons in distant cortical areas</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/534032v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/534032v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Intracortical microstimulation can be used successfully to modulate neuronal activity. Activity-dependent stimulation (ADS), in which action potentials recorded extracellularly from a single neuron are used to trigger stimulation at another cortical location (closed-loop), is an effective treatment for behavioral recovery after brain lesion in rodents. Neurophysiological changes in cortical communication induced by ADS, and how these changes differ from those induced by open-loop random stimulation (RS) are still not clear. Objectives: We investigated the ability of ADS and RS to induce changes in firing patterns in distant populations of neurons in healthy anesthetized rats. Methods: For this study we used 23 adult Long-Evan rats, recording from a total of 591 neuronal units. Stimulation was delivered to either forelimb or barrel field somatosensory cortex, using either randomly-timed stimulus pulses or ADS triggered from neuronal spikes recorded in the rostral forelimb area (RFA) of the motor cortex. Results: Both RS and ADS stimulation protocols rapidly altered spike firing within RFA compared with no stimulation. Changes consisted of increases in mean firing rates and patterns of spike firing as measured by the revised Local Variation metric. ADS was more effective than RS in increasing short-latency evoked spikes during the stimulation periods, by producing a reliable, progressive increase in stimulus-related activity over time. Conclusions: These results are critical for understanding the efficacy of electrical microstimulation protocols in altering activity patterns in interconnected brain networks. These data further strengthen the idea that activity-dependent microstimulation, can be used to modulate cortical state and functional connectivity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Network based statistics reveals trophic and neuroprotective effect of early high dose erythropoetin on brain connectivity in very preterm infants</title>

	<description>Periventricular white matter injury is common in very preterm infants and it is associated with long term neurodevelopmental impairments. While evidence supports the protective effects of erythropoetin (EPO) in preventing injury, we currently lack the complete understanding of how EPO affects the emergence and maturation of anatomical brain connectivity and function. In this case-control study, connectomic analysis based on diffusion MRI tractography was applied to evaluate the effect of early high-dose EPO in preterm infants. A whole brain, network-level analysis revealed a sub-network of anatomical brain connections in which connectivity strengths were significantly stronger in the EPO group. This distributed network comprised connections predominantly in the frontal and temporal lobe bilaterally, and the effect of EPO was focused on the peripheral and feeder con-nections. EPO resulted in a globally increased clustering coefficient and higher local efficiency, while higher strength, efficiency and increased clustering was found for regions in the temporal lobe, supramarginal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, in the caudate and cingulate gyri. The connectivity network most affected by the EPO treatment showed a steeper increase in FA with age compared to the placebo group. These results demonstrate a weak but widespread effect of EPO on the structural connectivity network and a possible trophic effect of EPO reflected by increasing network segregation, predominantly in local connections.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Complementary roles for ventral pallidum cell types and their projections in relapse</title>

	<description>Ventral pallidum (VP) is a key node in the neural circuits controlling relapse to drug seeking but how this role relates to different VP cell types and their projections is poorly understood. Using male rats, we show how different forms of relapse to alcohol-seeking are assembled from VP cell types and their projections to lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). First, we used RNAScope in situ hybridization to characterize activity of different VP cell types during relapse to alcohol-seeking provoked by renewal (context-induced reinstatement). We found that VP Gad1 and parvalbumin (PV), but not vGlut2, neurons show relapse-associated changes in c-Fos expression. Next, we used retrograde tracing, chemogenetic, optogenetic, and electrophysiological approaches to study the roles of VPGad1 and VPPV neurons in relapse. We show that VPGad1 neurons contribute to contextual control over relapse (renewal), but not to relapse during reacquisition, via projections to LH where they converge with ventral striatal inputs onto LHGad1 neurons. This convergence of striatopallidal inputs at the level of individual LHGad1 neurons may be critical to balancing propensity for relapse versus abstinence. In contrast, VPPV neurons contribute to relapse during both renewal and reacquisition via projections to VTA but not LH. These findings show complementary roles for different VP cell types and their projections in relapse. VPGad1 neurons control relapse during renewal via projections to LH whereas VPPV neurons control relapse during both renewal and reacquisition via projections to VTA. Targeting these different pathways may provide tailored interventions for different forms of relapse.</description>

	<description>Learning can cause significant changes in neural responses to relevant stimuli, in addition to modulation due to task engagement. However, it is not known how different functional types of excitatory neurons contribute to these changes. To address this gap, we performed two-photon calcium imaging of excitatory neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex before and after learning of a visual discrimination. We found that excitatory neurons show striking diversity in the temporal dynamics of their response to visual stimuli during the behavior, and based on this we classified them into transient, sustained, and suppressed groups. Notably, these functionally defined cell classes exhibit different visual stimulus selectivity and modulation by locomotion, and were differentially affected by training condition. In particular, we observed a decrease in the number of transient neurons responsive during behavior after learning, while both transient and sustained cells showed an increase in modulation due to task engagement after learning. The identification of functional diversity within the excitatory population, with distinct changes during learning and task engagement, provides insight into the cortical pathways that allow context-dependent neural representations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Impoverished auditory cues fail to engage brain networks controlling spatial selective attention</title>

	<description>Spatial selective attention enables listeners to process a signal of interest in natural settings. However, most past studies on auditory spatial attention used impoverished spatial cues: presenting competing sounds to different ears, using only interaural differences in time (ITDs) and/or intensity (IIDs), or using non-individualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Here we tested the hypothesis that impoverished spatial cues impair spatial auditory attention by only weakly engaging relevant cortical networks. Eighteen normal-hearing listeners reported the content of one of two competing syllable streams simulated at roughly +30{ring} and -30{ring} azimuth. The competing streams consisted of syllables from two different-sex talkers. Spatialization was based on natural spatial cues (individualized HRTFs), individualized IIDs, or generic ITDs. We measured behavioral performance as well as electroencephalographic markers of selective attention. Behaviorally, subjects recalled target streams most accurately with natural cues. Neurally, spatial attention significantly modulated early evoked sensory response magnitudes only for natural cues, not in conditions using only ITDs or IIDs. Consistent with this, parietal oscillatory power in the alpha band (8-14 Hz; associated with filtering out distracting events from unattended directions) showed significantly less attentional modulation with isolated spatial cues than with natural cues. Our findings support the hypothesis that spatial selective attention networks are only partially engaged by impoverished spatial auditory cues. These results not only suggest that studies using unnatural spatial cues underestimate the neural effects of spatial auditory attention, they also illustrate the importance of preserving natural spatial cues in assistive listening devices to support robust attentional control.</description>

	<description>Electron microscopy (EM) tends to be a tedious imaging technique that requires a diverse manual skill set, in particular when it comes to collecting and processing large numbers of consecutive ultrathin sections of biological tissue. To alleviate the challenges of collecting freshly cut sections floating on the water surface of an ultramicrotome, we have produced a magnetic resin that allows accumulation of sections under a magnet. Subsequent water removal deposits the dense section conglomerate onto an immersed EM imaging substrate. We describe an application of this workflow, termed Magnetic Section Collection (MagC), on hundreds of ultrathin sections of bird brain tissue that are deposited on a silicon wafer and imaged in both light and scanning electron microscopes, making MagC a highly convenient method for array tomography.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dedifferentiation orchestrated through remodeling of the chromatin landscape defines PSEN1 mutation-induced Alzheimer\'s Disease</title>

	<description>Early-Onset Familial Alzheimer's Disease (EOFAD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder elicited by mutations in the PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP genes. Hallmark pathological changes and symptoms observed, namely the accumulation of misfolded Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) in plaques and Tau aggregates in neurofibrillary tangles associated with memory loss and cognitive decline, are understood to be temporally accelerated manifestations of the more common sporadic Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease. The complete penetrance of EOFAD-causing mutations has allowed for experimental models which have proven integral to the overall understanding of AD. However, the failure of pathology-targeting therapeutic development suggests that the formation of plaques and tangles may be symptomatic and not describe the etiology of the disease. Here, we use an integrative, multi-omics approach and systems-level analysis in hiPSC-derived neurons to generate a mechanistic disease model for EOFAD. Using patient-specific cells from donors harboring mutations in PSEN1 differentiated into neurons, we characterize the disease-related gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes by RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq, and histone methylation ChIP-Seq. We show that the defining disease-causing mechanism of EOFAD is dedifferentiation, primarily through the REST-mediated repression of neuronal lineage specification gene programs and the activation of non-specific germ layer precursor gene programs concomitant with modifications in chromatin accessibility. These gene signature profiles and changes in chromatin topology illustrate that EOFAD neurons traverse the chromatin landscape from an ectodermal origin to a mixed germ lineage state. Further, a reanalysis of existing transcriptomic data from PSEN1 patient brain samples demonstrates that the mechanisms identified in our experimental system recapitulate EOFAD in the human brain. Our results comprise a disease model which describes the mechanisms culminating in dedifferentiation that precede amyloid and tau pathology formation and engender neurodegeneration.</description>

	<description>Fluctuations in the heart's activity can modulate the access of external stimuli to consciousness. The link between perceptual awareness and cardiac signals has been investigated mainly in the visual and auditory domain. We here investigated whether the phase of the cardiac cycle and the pre-stimulus heart rate influence conscious somatosensory perception. We also tested how conscious detection of somatosensory stimuli affects the heart rate. Electrocardiograms (ECG) of 33 healthy volunteers were recorded while applying near-threshold electrical pulses at a fixed intensity to the left index finger. Conscious detection was not uniformly distributed across the cardiac cycle but significantly higher in diastole than in systole. We found no evidence that the heart rate before a stimulus influenced its detection but hits (correctly detected somatosensory stimuli) led to a more pronounced cardiac deceleration than misses. Our findings demonstrate interactions between cardiac activity and conscious somatosensory perception, which highlights the importance of internal bodily states for sensory processing beyond the auditory and visual domain.</description>

Birdsong is a complex vocal communication signal, and like humans, birds need to discriminate between similar sequences of sound with different meanings. The caudal mesopallium (CM) is a cortical-level auditory area implicated in song discrimination. CM neurons respond sparsely to conspecific song and are tolerant of production variability. Intracellular recordings in CM have identified a diversity of intrinsic membrane dynamics, which could contribute to the emergence of these higher-order functional properties. We investigated this hypothesis using a novel linear-dynamical cascade model that incorporated detailed biophysical dynamics to simulate auditory responses to birdsong. Neuron models that included a low-threshold potassium current present in a subset of CM neurons showed increased selectivity and coding efficiency relative to models without this current. These results demonstrate the impact of intrinsic dynamics on sensory coding and the importance of including the biophysical characteristics of neural populations in simulation studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JCcLbdK_z5k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genome data, with underlying new knowledge, are accumulating at exponential rate thanks to ever-improving sequencing technologies and the parallel development of dedicated efficient Bioinformatics methods and tools. Advanced Education in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses is to a large extent not accessible to students in developing countries where endeavors to set up Bioinformatics courses concern most often only basic levels. Here, we report a pioneering pilot experience concerning the design and implementation, from scratch, of a three-months advanced and extensive course in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses in the Institut Pasteur de Tunis. Most significantly the outcome of the course was upgrading the participants’ skills in Bioinformatics and Genome Analyses to recognized international standards. Here we detail the different steps involved in the implementation of this course as well as the topics covered in the program. The description of this pilot experience might be helpful for the implementation of other similar educational projects, notably in developing countries, aiming to go beyond basics and providing young researchers with high-level skills.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jk3OXkDl4KM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Within influenza virus infected cells, viral genomic RNA are selectively packed into progeny virions, which predominantly contain a single copy of 8 viral RNA segments. Intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions are thought to mediate selective packaging of each viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP). Clear evidence of a specific interaction network culminating in the full genomic set has yet to be identified. Using multi-color fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to visualize four vRNP segments within a single cell, we developed image-based models of vRNP-vRNP spatial dependence. These models were used to construct likely sequences of vRNP associations resulting in the full genomic set. Our results support the notion that selective packaging occurs during cytoplasmic transport and identifies the formation of multiple distinct vRNP sub-complexes that likely form as intermediate steps toward full genomic inclusion into a progeny virion. The methods employed demonstrate a statistically driven, model based approach applicable to other interaction and assembly problems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/99ZwYvNlJkU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Centrifugal innervation of the olfactory bulb: a reappraisal</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The inter-regional connectivity of sensory structures in the brain allows for the modulation of sensory processing in manners important for perception. In the olfactory system, odor representations in the olfactory bulb (OB) are modulated by feedback centrifugal innervation from several olfactory cortices, including the piriform cortex and anterior olfactory nucleus. Previous studies reported that an additional olfactory cortex, the olfactory tubercle, also centrifugally innervates the OB and may even shape the activity of OB output neurons. In an attempt to identify the cell-types of this centrifugal innervation, we performed retrograde tracing experiments in mice utilizing three unique strategies, including retrobeads, retrograde adeno-associated virus (AAV) driving a fluorescent reporter, and retrograde AAV driving Cre-expression in the Ai9 floxed transgenic reporter line. Our results replicated the standing literature and uncovered robustly labeled neurons in the ipsilateral piriform cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, and numerous other structures known to innervate the OB. Surprisingly, consistent throughout all of our approaches, no labeled soma were observed in the olfactory tubercle. These findings indicate that the olfactory tubercle is unique among other olfactory cortices in that it does not innervate the OB, which refines our understanding of the centrifugal modulation of the OB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The perception of our environment relies upon the distribution of sensory information throughout brain regions. This is true in the olfactory system wherein projections between olfactory centers, including feedback centrifugal input to the olfactory bulb, provide the basis for olfactory perception. Here, we show that one olfactory cortical structure, the olfactory tubercle, is unique among olfactory cortices in that it lacks feedback projections to the olfactory bulb. This ‘negative result’ is important in that it refines current models for the circuitry of our olfactory system and challenges previous literature reporting such a pathway in fact exists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Stress causes divergent patterns of structural and physiological plasticity in the hippocampus versus amygdala. However, a majority of earlier studies focused primarily on neurons. Despite growing evidence for the importance of glia in health and disease, relatively little is known about how stress affects astrocytes. Further, previous work focused on hippocampal astrocytes. Hence, we examined the impact of chronic immobilization stress (2 h/day, 10 days), on the number and structure of astrocytes in the rat hippocampus and amygdala. We observed a reduction in the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes in the basal amygdala (BA), a day after the end of 10 days of chronic stress. Detailed morphometric analysis of individual dye-filled astrocytes also revealed a decrease in the neuropil volume occupied by these astrocytes in the BA, alongside a reduction in the volume fraction of fine astrocytic protrusions rather than larger dendrite-like processes. By contrast, the same chronic stress had no effect on the number or morphology of astrocytes in hippocampal area CA3. We also confirmed previous reports that chronic stress triggers dendritic hypertrophy in dye-filled BA principal neurons that were located adjacent to astrocytes that had undergone atrophy. Thus, building on earlier evidence for contrasting patterns of stress-induced plasticity in neurons across brain areas, our findings offer new evidence that the same stress can also elicit divergent morphological effects in astrocytes in the hippocampus versus the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Despite accumulating evidence on the role of astrocytes in health and disease, relatively little is known about the effects of stress on these cells. We report here, for the first time, that the divergent effects of chronic immobilization stress on the morphological properties of neurons in hippocampus and amygdala also extend to astrocytes in the rat brain. Chronic stress reduces the number of astrocytes in the amygdala, without affecting them in the hippocampus. Strikingly, the same stress elicits divergent morphological effects – neuronal hypertrophy versus atrophy of astrocytes – in the amygdala. These findings underscore the need to further examine non-cell autonomous, astroglial mediated effects elicited by stress, and how these vary across brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Higher levels of protein palmitoylation in the frontal cortex across aging were associated with reference memory and executive function declines.</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline with aging is often due to altered levels of protein expression. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) and the complex of proteins surrounding the receptor are susceptible to age-related changes in expression. In the frontal cortex of aged mice, there is significant loss of expression of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDAr, an increase in Fyn expression, and no change in PSD-95. Studies have also found that, in the frontal cortex, phosphorylation of GluN2B subunits and palmitoylation of GluN2 subunits and NMDAr complex proteins are affected by age. In this study, we examined some of the factors that may lead to the differences in the palmitoylation levels of NMDAr complex proteins in the frontal cortex of aged animals. The Morris water maze was used to test spatial learning in 3 and 24-month-old mice. The acyl-biotinyl exchange (ABE) method was used to precipitate palmitoylated proteins from the frontal cortices and hippocampi of the mice. Additionally, brain lysates from old and young mice were probed for expression of fatty acid transporter proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An age-related increase of palmitoylated GluN2A, GluN2B, Fyn, PSD-95, and APT1 in the frontal cortex was associated with poorer reference memory and/or executive functions. These data suggest that there may be a perturbation in the palmitoylation cycle in the frontal cortex of aged mice that contributes to age-related cognitive declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Cognitive decline due to aging significantly impacts the quality of life of those affected, as well as their families. Although data has shown that there isn’t a dramatic loss of neurons in the aged brain, the expression of some proteins essential for memory dwindle with advanced age. However, other proteins remain constant or increase with age. Posttranslational modification of proteins via palmitoylation significantly alters the function of signaling molecules in the brain. We found an age-related increase in the percentage of NMDA receptor-associated proteins that were palmitoylated in the frontal cortex of mice, which were associated with age-related deficits in memory and executive functions. This finding may point to a previously unexplored mechanism of cognitive decline in older individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence suggests that necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, contributes to neurodegeneration in several disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Supporting this view, both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; investigations in models of ALS have implicated key molecular determinants of necroptosis in the death of spinal motor neurons. To confirm the pathogenic role of necroptosis in ALS, we showed increased mRNA levels for the three main necroptosis effectors &lt;i&gt;Ripk1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ripk3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mlkl&lt;/i&gt; in the spinal cord of mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt;) transgenic mice (Tg), an established model of ALS. In addition, protein levels of RIPK1 (but not of RIPK3, MLKL or activated MLKL) were elevated in spinal cord extracts from these Tg SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice. In post-mortem motor cortex samples from sporadic and familial ALS patients, no changes in protein levels of RIPK1 were detected. Silencing of &lt;i&gt;Ripk3&lt;/i&gt; in cultured motor neurons protected them from toxicity associated with SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; astrocytes. However, constitutive deletion of &lt;i&gt;Ripk3&lt;/i&gt; in Tg SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice failed to provide behavioral and neuropathological improvement, demonstrating no similar benefit of &lt;i&gt;Ripk3&lt;/i&gt; silencing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Lastly, no genotype-specific myelin decompaction – proposed to be a proxy of necroptosis in ALS – was detected in either Tg SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Optineurin&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice, another ALS mouse model. These findings argue against a role for RIPK3 in Tg SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt;-induced neurodegeneration and call for further preclinical investigations prior to concluding that necroptosis plays a critical pathogenic role in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Studies in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) suggest an instrumental role for necroptosis in this currently incurable disease. Given the availability of a growing number of small molecules that inhibit key determinants of necroptosis, implication of this form of programmed cell death in ALS may open new therapeutic avenues. We found that despite changes in the expression of key necroptosis determinants, targeting RIPK3 prevents motor neuron death &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; but not &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These results challenge the suggestion that targeting RIPK3 to abrogate necroptosis will provide therapeutic benefit in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Several influential theories of consciousness attempt to explain how, when and where conscious perception arises in the brain. The extent of conscious perception of a stimulus is often probed by asking subjects to provide confidence estimations in their choices in challenging perceptual decision making tasks. Here, we aimed to dissociate neural patterns of ‘cognitive’ and ‘sensory’ information maintenance by linking category selective visual processes to decision confidence using multivariate decoding techniques on human EEG data. Participants discriminated at-threshold masked face versus house stimuli and reported confidence in their discrimination performance. Three distinct types of category-selective neural activity patterns were observed, dissociable by their timing, scalp topography, relationship with decision confidence, and generalization profile. An early (~150–200ms) decoding profile was unrelated to confidence and quickly followed by two distinct decodable patterns of late neural activity (350–500ms). One pattern was &lt;i&gt;on-&lt;/i&gt;diagonal, global and highly related to decision confidence, likely indicating ‘cognitive’ maintenance of consciously reportable stimulus representations. The other pattern however was &lt;i&gt;off-&lt;/i&gt;diagonal, restricted to posterior electrode sites (local), and independent of decision confidence, and therefore may reflect ‘sensory’ maintenance of category-specific information, possibly operating via recurrent processes within visual cortices. These results highlight that two functionally independent neural processes are operating in parallel, only one of which is related to decision confidence and conscious access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The aim of the present study was to dissociate neural patterns of ‘cognitive’ (confidence dependent) and ‘sensory’ (confidence independent) category-selective information maintenance using multivariate decoding techniques on human EEG data. We found evidence of two functionally independent feedback-related neural processes operating in parallel. One pattern was global and related to decision confidence, likely indicating ‘cognitive’ maintenance of consciously reportable stimulus representations. The other pattern was restricted to posterior electrode sites and unrelated to decision confidence, indicating ‘sensory’ maintenance of category-specific information within visual cortices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neurons have evolved a number of unique protein-coding genes that regulate trafficking of protein complexes within small organelles throughout dendrites and axons. Neuron-specific gene 2 (NSG2) encodes for one of the most abundant proteins in the nervous system during perinatal development. NSG2 belongs to a family of small neuronal endosomal proteins but its function has remained uncharacterized to date. Here, we show that NSG2 is found in discrete punctae restricted to the somatodendritic arbors of developing mouse and human neurons, and a significant proportion of NSG2 punctae colocalize with postsynaptic HOMER1 and surface-expressed AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) at excitatory synapses. Immunoprecipitation revealed that NSG2 physically interacts with both the GluA1 and GluA2 AMPAR subunits in mouse brain. Knock-out of NSG2 in mouse hippocampal neurons selectively impaired the frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) and caused alterations in PSD95 expression at postsynaptic densities (PSDs). In contrast, NSG2 overexpression caused a significant increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs as well as GluA2 surface expression. Thus, NSG2 functions as an AMPAR-binding protein that is required for normal synapse formation and/or maintenance, and has unique functions compared with other NSG family members.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Isoflurane Inhibits Dopaminergic Synaptic Vesicle Exocytosis Coupled to CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 in Rat Midbrain Neurons</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Volatile anesthetics affect neuronal signaling by poorly understood mechanisms. Activation of central dopaminergic pathways has been implicated in emergence from general anesthesia. The volatile anesthetic isoflurane differentially inhibits glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis by reducing presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx without affecting the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-exocytosis relationship, but its effects on dopaminergic exocytosis are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that isoflurane inhibits exocytosis in dopaminergic neurons. We used electrical stimulation or depolarization by elevated extracellular KCl to evoke exocytosis measured by quantitative live-cell fluorescence imaging in cultured rat ventral tegmental area neurons. Using trains of electrically evoked action potentials (APs), isoflurane inhibited exocytosis in dopaminergic neurons to a greater extent (30 ± 4% inhibition; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) than in non-dopaminergic neurons (15 ± 5% inhibition; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.014). Isoflurane also inhibited exocytosis evoked by elevated KCl in dopaminergic neurons (35 ± 6% inhibition; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0007), but not in non-dopaminergic neurons (2 ± 4% inhibition). Pharmacological isolation of presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel subtypes showed that isoflurane inhibited KCl-evoked exocytosis mediated exclusively by either Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 (P/Q-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels; 30 ± 5% inhibition; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002) or by Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2 (N-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels; 35 ± 11% inhibition; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015). Additionally, isoflurane inhibited single AP-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx by 41 ± 3% and single AP-evoked exocytosis by 34 ± 6%. Comparable reductions in exocytosis and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx were produced by lowering extracellular [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]. Thus, isoflurane inhibits exocytosis from dopaminergic neurons by a mechanism distinct from that in non-dopaminergic neurons involving reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry through Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 and/or Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: NMNAT Proteins that Limit Wallerian Degeneration Also Regulate Critical Period Plasticity in the Visual Cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Many brain regions go through critical periods of development during which plasticity is enhanced. These critical periods are associated with extensive growth and retraction of thalamocortical and intracortical axons. Here, we investigated whether a signaling pathway that is central in Wallerian axon degeneration also regulates critical period plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V1). Wallerian degeneration is characterized by rapid disintegration of axons once they are separated from the cell body. This degenerative process is initiated by reduced presence of cytoplasmic nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs) and is strongly delayed in mice overexpressing cytoplasmic NMNAT proteins, such as Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mice producing a UBE4b-NMNAT1 fusion protein or NMNAT3 transgenic mice. Here, we provide evidence that in Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mice and NMNAT3 transgenic mice, ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in the developing visual cortex is reduced. This deficit is only observed during the second half of the critical period. Additionally, we detect an early increase of visual acuity in the V1 of Wld&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We do not find evidence for Wallerian degeneration occurring during OD plasticity. Our findings suggest that NMNATs do not only regulate Wallerian degeneration during pathological conditions but also control cellular events that mediate critical period plasticity during the physiological development of the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel diffusion‐weighted MRI protocol sensitive to contraction of individual skeletal motor units was developed. We applied this technique to the lower limb muscles of 4 patients with confirmed ALS and six healthy controls. A 3‐minute scan revealed florid fasciculation in ALS patients, involving both superficial and deep muscles, and at a frequency higher than in healthy controls. This novel imaging technique reveals hitherto unobtainable information on human motor unit structure and function, which may allow earlier diagnosis and recruitment to clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modern neuroscience is currently limited in its capacity to perform long
term, wide-field measurements of neuron electromagnetics with nanoscale
resolution. Quantum microscopy using the nitrogen vacancy centre (NV) can
provide a potential solution to this problem with electric and magnetic field
sensing at nano-scale resolution and good biocompatibility. However, the
performance of existing NV sensing technology does not allow for studies of
small mammalian neurons yet. In this paper, we propose a solution to this
problem by engineering NV quantum sensors in diamond nanopillar arrays. The
pillars improve light collection efficiency by guiding excitation/emission
light, which improves sensitivity. More importantly, they also improve the size
of the signal at the NV by removing screening charges as well as coordinating
the neuron growth to the tips of the pillars where the NV is located. Here, we
provide a growth study to demonstrate coordinated neuron growth as well as the
first simulation of nano-scopic neuron electric and magnetic fields to assess
the enhancement provided by the nanopillar geometry.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Ablation Studies in Artificial Neural Networks. (arXiv:1901.08644v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ablation studies have been widely used in the field of neuroscience to tackle
complex biological systems such as the extensively studied Drosophila central
nervous system, the vertebrate brain and more interestingly and most
delicately, the human brain. In the past, these kinds of studies were utilized
to uncover structure and organization in the brain, i.e. a mapping of features
inherent to external stimuli onto different areas of the neocortex. considering
the growth in size and complexity of state-of-the-art artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and the corresponding growth in complexity of the tasks that
are tackled by these networks, the question arises whether ablation studies may
be used to investigate these networks for a similar organization of their inner
representations. In this paper, we address this question and performed two
ablation studies in two fundamentally different ANNs to investigate their inner
representations of two well-known benchmark datasets from the computer vision
domain. We found that features distinct to the local and global structure of
the data are selectively represented in specific parts of the network.
Furthermore, some of these representations are redundant, awarding the network
a certain robustness to structural damages. We further determined the
importance of specific parts of the network for the classification task solely
based on the weight structure of single units. Finally, we examined the ability
of damaged networks to recover from the consequences of ablations by means of
recovery training. We argue that ablations studies are a feasible method to
investigate knowledge representations in ANNs and are especially helpful to
examine a networks robustness to structural damages, a feature of ANNs that
will become increasingly important for future safety-critical applications.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Localization Algorithm with Circular Representation in 2D and its Similarity to Mammalian Brains. (arXiv:1809.02910v2 [cs.RO] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Extended Kalman filter (EKF) does not guarantee consistent mean and
covariance under linearization, even though it is the main framework for
robotic localization. While Lie group improves the modeling of the state space
in localization, the EKF on Lie group still relies on the arbitrary Gaussian
assumption in face of nonlinear models. We instead use von Mises filter for
orientation estimation together with the conventional Kalman filter for
position estimation, and thus we are able to characterize the first two moments
of the state estimates. Since the proposed algorithm holds a solid
probabilistic basis, it is fundamentally relieved from the inconsistency
problem. Furthermore, we extend the localization algorithm to fully circular
representation even for position, which is similar to grid patterns found in
mammalian brains and in recurrent neural networks. The applicability of the
proposed algorithms is substantiated not only by strong mathematical foundation
but also by the comparison against other common localization methods.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Collider bias and the apparent protective effect of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency on cerebral malaria</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43154</link>
	<description>Case fatality rates in severe falciparum malaria depend on the pattern and degree of vital organ dysfunction. Recent large-scale case-control analyses of pooled severe malaria data reported that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) was protective against cerebral malaria but increased the risk of severe malarial anaemia. A novel formulation of the balancing selection hypothesis was proposed as an explanation for these findings, whereby the selective advantage is driven by the competing risks of death from cerebral malaria and death from severe malarial anaemia. We re-analysed these claims using causal diagrams and showed that they are subject to collider bias. A simulation based sensitivity analysis, varying the strength of the known effect of G6PDd on anaemia, showed that this bias is sufficient to explain all of the observed association. Future genetic epidemiology studies in severe malaria would benefit from the use of causal reasoning.</description>

	<description>The fibroblast growth factor FGF21 was labeled with molecularly defined gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), applied to human adipocytes, and imaged by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Most AuNPs were in pairs about 80 Å apart, on the outer cell surface. Pairs of AuNPs were also abundant inside the cells in clathrin-coated vesicles and endosomes. AuNPs were present but no longer paired in multivesicular bodies. FGF21 could thus be tracked along the endocytotic pathway. The methods developed here to visualize signaling coupled to endocytosis can be applied to a wide variety of cargo and may be extended to studies of other intracellular transactions.</description>

	<description>Neurons recorded in behaving animals often do not discernibly respond to sensory input and are not overtly task-modulated. These non-classically responsive neurons are difficult to interpret and are typically neglected from analysis, confounding attempts to connect neural activity to perception and behavior. Here we describe a trial-by-trial, spike-timing-based algorithm to reveal the coding capacities of these neurons in auditory and frontal cortex of behaving rats. Classically responsive and non-classically responsive cells contained significant information about sensory stimuli and behavioral decisions. Stimulus category was more accurately represented in frontal cortex than auditory cortex, via ensembles of non-classically responsive cells coordinating the behavioral meaning of spike timings on correct but not error trials. This unbiased approach allows the contribution of all recorded neurons – particularly those without obvious task-related, trial-averaged firing rate modulation – to be assessed for behavioral relevance on single trials.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42001</link>
	<description>Most replicative helicases are hexameric, ring-shaped motor proteins that translocate on and unwind DNA. Despite extensive biochemical and structural investigations, how their translocation activity is utilized chemo-mechanically in DNA unwinding is poorly understood. We examined DNA unwinding by G40P, a DnaB-family helicase, using a single-molecule fluorescence assay with a single base pair resolution. The high-resolution assay revealed that G40P by itself is a very weak helicase that stalls at barriers as small as a single GC base pair and unwinds DNA with the step size of a single base pair. Binding of a single ATPgS could stall unwinding, demonstrating highly coordinated ATP hydrolysis between six identical subunits. We observed frequent slippage of the helicase, which is fully suppressed by the primase DnaG. We anticipate that these findings allow a better understanding on the fine balance of thermal fluctuation activation and energy derived from hydrolysis.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Correct setup of the substantia nigra requires Reelin-mediated fast, laterally-directed migration of dopaminergic neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.41623</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41623</link>
	<description>Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons migrate to form the laterally-located substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) and medially-located ventral tegmental area (VTA), but little is known about the underlying cellular and molecular processes. Here we visualize the dynamic cell morphologies of tangentially migrating SN-mDA neurons in 3D and identify two distinct migration modes. Slow migration is the default mode in SN-mDA neurons, while fast, laterally-directed migration occurs infrequently and is strongly associated with bipolar cell morphology. Tangential migration of SN-mDA neurons is altered in absence of Reelin signaling, but it is unclear whether Reelin acts directly on migrating SN-mDA neurons and how it affects their cell morphology and migratory behavior. By specifically inactivating Reelin signaling in mDA neurons we demonstrate its direct role in SN-mDA tangential migration. Reelin promotes laterally-biased movements in mDA neurons during their slow migration mode, stabilizes leading process morphology and increases the probability of fast, laterally-directed migration.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41028</link>
	<description>In stereotyped neuronal networks, synaptic connectivity is dictated by cell surface proteins, which assign unique identities to neurons, and physically mediate axon guidance and synapse targeting. We recently identified two groups of immunoglobulin superfamily proteins in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, Dprs and DIPs, as strong candidates for synapse targeting functions. Here, we uncover the molecular basis of specificity in Dpr–DIP mediated cellular adhesions and neuronal connectivity. First, we present five crystal structures of Dpr–DIP and DIP–DIP complexes, highlighting the evolutionary and structural origins of diversification in Dpr and DIP proteins and their interactions. We further show that structures can be used to rationally engineer receptors with novel specificities or modified affinities, which can be used to study specific circuits that require Dpr–DIP interactions to help establish connectivity. We investigate one pair, engineered Dpr10 and DIP-α, for function in the neuromuscular circuit in flies, and reveal roles for homophilic and heterophilic binding in wiring.</description>

	<description>Cell lineages provide the framework for understanding how cell fates are decided during development. Describing cell lineages in most organisms is challenging; even a fruit fly larva has ~50,000 cells and a small mammal has &amp;gt;1 billion cells. Recently, the idea of applying CRISPR to induce mutations during development, to be used as heritable markers for lineage reconstruction, has been proposed by several groups. While an attractive idea, its practical value depends on the accuracy of the cell lineages that can be generated. Here, we use computer simulations to estimate the performance of these approaches under different conditions. We incorporate empirical data on CRISPR-induced mutation frequencies in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. We show significant impacts from multiple biological and technical parameters - variable cell division rates, skewed mutational outcomes, target dropouts and different sequencing strategies. Our approach reveals the limitations of published CRISPR recorders, and indicates how future implementations can be optimised.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Stability of dynamic functional architecture differs between brain networks and states</title>

	<description>Stable representation of information in distributed neural connectivity is critical to function effectively in the world. Despite the dynamic nature of the brain's functional architecture, characterizing its temporal stability has been largely neglected. Here we characterized stability of functional architecture for each brain voxel by measuring the concordance of dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) over time, and explored how stability was modified by movie watching. High-order association regions, especially the default mode network, demonstrated high stability during resting state scans, while primary sensory-motor cortices revealed relatively lower stability. During movie watching, stability in the primary visual cortex was decreased, which was associated with larger DFC variation with neighboring regions. By contrast, higher-order regions in the ventral and dorsal visual stream demonstrated increased stability. The distribution of functional stability and its modification describes a profile of the brain's stability property, which may be useful reference for examining distinct mental states and disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Extinction-resistant attention to long-term conditioned threat is indexed by selective visuocortical alpha suppression in humans</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/533141v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>While ERP studies have shown heightened early visual attention to conditioned threat, it is unknown whether this attentional prioritization is sustained throughout later processing stages and whether it is robust to extinction. To investigate sustained visual attention, we assessed visuocortical alpha suppression in response to conditioned and extinguished threat. N = 87 participants underwent a two-day threat conditioning paradigm with acquisition and extinction on one day and a critical recall test one day later. EEG time-frequency analyses revealed that, on Day 2, threat-conditioned vs. safety cues evoked stronger occipital alpha power suppression from 600 to 1200 ms. Notably, this suppression was resistant to extinction. The present study showed for the first time that threat conditioning enhances sustained modulation of visuocortical attention to threat in the long term. The long-term stability and extinction resistance of alpha suppression suggests a crucial role of visuocortical attention mechanisms in the maintenance of learned fears.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamic CRMP2 regulation of CaV2.2 in the prefrontal cortex contributes to the reinstatementof cocaine seeking</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/533083v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/533083v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Cocaine addiction is a major health concern with limited effective treatment options. A better understanding of mechanisms underlying relapse may help inform the development of new pharmacotherapies. Emerging evidence suggests that collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) regulates presynaptic excitatory neurotransmission and contributes to pathological changes during diseases, such as neuropathic pain and substance use disorders. We examined the role of CRMP2 and its interactions with a known binding partner, CaV2.2, in cocaine-seeking behavior. We employed the rodent self-administration model of relapse to drug-seeking and focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) for its well-established role in reinstatement behaviors. Our results indicated that repeated cocaine self-administration resulted in a dynamic and persistent alteration in the PFC expression of CRMP2 and its binding partner, the CaV2.2 (N-type) voltage-gated calcium channel. Following cocaine self-administration and extinction training, the expression of both CRMP2 and CaV2.2 was reduced relative to Yoked saline controls. By contrast, cued-reinstatement potentiated CRMP2 expression and increased CaV2.2 expression above extinction levels. Lastly, we utilized the recently developed peptide myr-TAT-CBD3 to disrupt the interaction between CRMP2 and CaV2.2 in vivo. We assessed the reinstatement behavior after infusing this peptide directly into the medial PFC and found that it decreased cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Taken together, these data suggest that neuroadaptations in the CRMP2/CaV2.2 signaling cascade in the PFC can facilitate drug seeking behavior. Targeting such interactions has implications for the treatment of cocaine relapse behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Applying stochastic spike train theory for high-accuracy MEG/EEG</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/532879v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/532879v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The accuracy of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) is challenged by overlapping sources from within the brain. This lack of accuracy is a severe limitation to the possibilities and reliability of modern stimulation protocols in basic research and clinical diagnostics. As a solution, we here introduce a theory of stochastic neuronal spike timing probability densities for describing the large-scale spiking activity in neural networks, and a novel spike density component analysis (SCA) method for isolating specific neural sources. Three studies are conducted based on 564 cases of evoked responses to auditory stimuli from 94 human subjects each measured with 60 EEG electrodes and 306 MEG sensors. In the first study we show that the large-scale spike timing (but not non-encephalographic artifacts) in MEG/EEG waveforms can be modeled with Gaussian probability density functions with high accuracy (median 99.7%-99.9% variance explained), while gamma and sine functions fail describing the MEG and EEG waveforms. In the second study we confirm that SCA can isolate a specific evoked response of interest. Our findings indicate that the mismatch negativity (MMN) response is accurately isolated with SCA, while principal component analysis (PCA) fails supressing interference from overlapping brain activity, e.g. from P3a and alpha waves, and independent component analysis (ICA) distorts the evoked response. Finally, we confirm that SCA accurately reveals inter-individual variation in evoked brain responses, by replicating findings relating individual traits with MMN variations. The findings of this paper suggest that the commonly overlapping neural sources in single-subject or patient data can be more accurately separated by applying the introduced theory of large-scale spike timing and method of SCA, when compared to PCA and ICA.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Sequence-dependent trafficking of GDE2, a GPI-specific phospholipase promoting neuronal differentiation</title>

	<description>GDE2 is a six-transmembrane glycerophosphodiesterase with phospholipase D-like activity that cleaves select glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and thereby influences biological signaling cascades. GDE2 promotes neuronal differentiation cell-autonomously through glypican cleavage and is a prognostic marker in neuroblastoma, while GDE2 deficiency causes progressive neurodegeneration in mice and developmental defects in zebrafish. However, the regulation of GDE2 remains unclear. Here we show that in undifferentiated neuronal cells, GDE2 undergoes constitutive internalization and traffics back along both fast and slow recycling routes, while a small percentage is sorted to late endosomes. GDE2 trafficking is dictated by distinctive C-terminal tail sequences that determine secretion, endocytosis and recycling preference, respectively, and thereby regulate GDE2 function both positively and negatively. Our study reveals the sequence determinants of GDE2 trafficking and surface localization, and provides insight into the control of GPI-anchored protein activities with potential implications for nervous system disorders associated with impaired trafficking and beyond.</description>

	<description>Background: With advances in methods for collecting and analyzing fMRI data, there is a concurrent need to understand how to reliably evaluate and optimally use these methods. Simulations of fMRI data can aid in both the evaluation of complex designs and the analysis of data. New Method: We present fmrisim, a new Python package for standardized, realistic simulation of fMRI data. This package is part of BrainIAK: a recently released open-source Python toolbox for advanced neuroimaging analyses. We describe how to use fmrisim to extract noise properties from real fMRI data and then create a synthetic dataset with matched noise properties and a user-specified signal. Results: We validate the noise generated by fmrisim to show that it can approximate the noise properties of real data. We further show how fmrisim can help researchers find the optimal design in terms of power. Comparison with other methods: fmrisim ports the functionality of other packages to the Python platform while extending what is available in order to make it seamless to simulate realistic fMRI data. Conclusions: The fmrisim package holds promise for improving the design of fMRI experiments, which may facilitate both the pre-registration</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Disease-associated scaffold protein CNK2 modulates PSD size and influences trafficking of new synaptic binding partner TNIK</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/532374v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Scaffold proteins are responsible for structural organisation within cells; they form complexes with other proteins to facilitate signalling pathways and catalytic reactions. The scaffold protein connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of Ras 2 (CNK2) is predominantly expressed in neural tissues and was recently implicated in X-linked intellectual disability (ID). We have investigated the role of CNK2 in neurons in order to contribute to our understanding of how CNK2 alterations might cause developmental defects, and we have elucidated a functional role for CNK2 in the molecular processes that govern morphology of the postsynaptic density (PSD). We have also identified novel CNK2 interaction partners and explored their functional interdependency with CNK2. We focussed on the novel interaction partner TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase TNIK, which is also associated with ID. Both CNK2 and TNIK are expressed in neuronal dendrites and concentrated in dendritic spines, and staining with synaptic markers indicates a clear postsynaptic localisation. Importantly, our data highlight that CNK2 plays a role in directing TNIK subcellular localisation, and in neurons, CNK2 participates in ensuring that this multifunctional kinase is present at desirable levels at synaptic sites. In summary, our data indicate that CNK2 expression is critical for modulating PSD morphology; moreover, our study highlights a role for CNK2 in directing the localisation of regulatory proteins within the cell. Importantly, we describe a novel link between CNK2 and the regulatory kinase TNIK, and provide evidence supporting the idea that these proteins play complementary roles in the regulation of dendritic spine growth and maintenance.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Prevalence of near-death experiences and REM sleep intrusion in 1034 adults from 35 countries</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/532341v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/532341v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Near-death experiences have fascinated humans for centuries, but their origin and prevalence remain unknown. Methods: Using an online crowdsourcing platform, we recruited 1034 lay people from 35 countries to investigate the prevalence of near-death experiences and self-reported REM sleep intrusion. Reports were validated using the Greyson Near-Death Experiences Scale (GNDES) with a score of [≥]7 as cut-off point for identifying near-death experiences. Results: Near-death experiences were reported by 106 of 1034 participants (10%; CI 95% 8.5-12%). REM sleep intrusion was more common in people with near-death experiences (n=50/106; 47%) than in people with experiences with 6 points or less on the GNDES (n=47/183; 26%) or in those without any such experience (n=107/744; 14%; p=&amp;lt;0.0001). Following multivariate regression analysis to adjust for age, gender, place of origin, employment status and perceived danger, this association remained highly significant; people with REM sleep intrusion were more likely to exhibit near-death experiences than those without REM sleep abnormalities (odds ratio 2.85; CI 95% 1.68-4.88; p=0.0001). Conclusions: The prevalence of near-death experiences in the public is around 10%. While age, gender, place of residence, employment status and perceived threat do not seem to influence the prevalence of near-death experiences, there is a significant association with REM sleep intrusion. This finding is in line with the view that despite imminent threat to life, brain physiology must be well-preserved to perceive these fascinating experiences and store them as long-term memories.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spatial synchronization codes from coupled rate-phase neurons</title>

During spatial navigation, the frequency and timing of spikes from spatial neurons including place cells in hippocampus and grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex are temporally organized by continuous theta oscillations (6–11 Hz). The theta rhythm is regulated by subcortical structures including the medial septum, but it is unclear how spatial information from place cells may reciprocally organize subcortical theta-rhythmic activity. Here we recorded single-unit spiking from a constellation of subcortical and hippocampal sites to study spatial modulation of rhythmic spike timing in rats freely exploring an open environment. Our analysis revealed a novel class of neurons that we termed ‘phaser cells,’ characterized by a symmetric coupling between firing rate and spike theta-phase. Phaser cells encoded space by assigning distinct phases to allocentric isocontour levels of each cell’s spatial firing pattern. In our dataset, phaser cells were predominantly located in the lateral septum, but also the hippocampus, anteroventral thalamus, lateral hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens. Unlike the unidirectional late-to-early phase precession of place cells, bidirectional phase modulation acted to return phaser cells to the same theta-phase along a given spatial isocontour, including cells that characteristically shifted to later phases at higher firing rates. Our dynamical models of intrinsic theta-bursting neurons demonstrated that experience-independent temporal coding mechanisms can qualitatively explain (1) the spatial rate-phase relationships of phaser cells and (2) the observed temporal segregation of phaser cells according to phase-shift direction. In open-field phaser cell simulations, competitive learning embedded phase-code entrainment maps into the weights of downstream targets, including path integration networks. Bayesian phase decoding revealed error correction capable of resetting path integration at subsecond timescales. Our findings suggest that phaser cells may instantiate a subcortical theta-rhythmic loop of spatial feedback. We outline a framework in which location-dependent synchrony reconciles internal idiothetic processes with the allothetic reference points of sensory experience.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zGh30KsIyYw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Its larval stages are small and transparent, enabling whole-body analyses of cell-type diversity and neuronal circuits. Here, we review the diversity of neuronal cell types in &lt;em&gt;Platynereis&lt;/em&gt;.

The function of several cell types and neuronal circuits has also been analysed with experimental approaches. &lt;em&gt;Platynereis&lt;/em&gt; has aspects of biology and cell types that are absent from the major invertebrate model organisms (&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;) including ciliary locomotion, noradrenergic neurons and ciliary photoreceptor cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Brain Network Topology Maps the Dysfunctional Substrate of Cognitive Processes in Schizophrenia. (arXiv:1901.08521v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Using a novel network analysis of spontaneous low-frequency functional MRI
data recorded at rest, we study the functional network that describes the
extent of synchronization among different areas of the brain. Comparing
forty-four medicated patients and forty healthy subjects, we detected
significant differences in the robustness of these functional networks. Such
differences resulted in a larger resistance to edge removal (disconnection) in
the graph of schizophrenic patients as compared to healthy controls. This paper
shows that the distribution of connectivity strength among brain regions is
spatially more homogeneous in schizophrenic patients with respect to healthy
ones. As a consequence, the precise hierarchical modularity of healthy brains
is crumbled in schizophrenic ones, making possible a peculiar arrangement of
region-to-region interaction that, in turns, produces several topologically
equivalent backbones of the whole functional brain network. We hypothesize that
the manifold nature of the basal scheme of functional organization within the
brain, together with its altered hierarchical modularity, contributes to
positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Our work also fits the disconnection
hypothesis that describes schizophrenia as a brain disorder, characterized by
abnormal functional integration among brain regions.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08355</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cortex exhibits self-sustained highly-irregular activity even under
resting conditions, whose origin and function need to be fully understood. It
is believed that this can be described as an &quot;asynchronous state&quot; stemming from
the balance between excitation and inhibition, with important consequences for
information-processing, though a competing hypothesis claims it stems from
critical dynamics. By analyzing a parsimonious neural-network model with
excitatory and inhibitory interactions, we elucidate a noise-induced mechanism
called &quot;Jensen's force&quot; responsible for the emergence of a novel phase of
arbitrarily-low but self-sustained activity, which reproduces all the
experimental features of asynchronous states. The simplicity of our framework
allows for a deep understanding of asynchronous states from a broad
statistical-mechanics perspective and of the phase transitions to other
standard phases it exhibits, opening the door to reconcile, asynchronous-state
and critical-state hypotheses. We argue that Jensen's forces are measurable
experimentally and might be relevant in contexts beyond neuroscience.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most of mathematic forgetting curve models fit well with the forgetting data
under the learning condition of one time rather than repeated. In the paper, a
convolution model of forgetting curve is proposed to simulate the memory
process during learning. In this model, the memory ability (i.e. the central
procedure in the working memory model) and learning material (i.e. the input in
the working memory model) is regarded as the system function and the input
function, respectively. The status of forgetting (i.e. the output in the
working memory model) is regarded as output function or the convolution result
of the memory ability and learning material. The model is applied to simulate
the forgetting curves in different situations. The results show that the model
is able to simulate the forgetting curves not only in one time learning
condition but also in multi-times condition. The model is further verified in
the experiments of Mandarin tone learning for Japanese learners. And the
predicted curve fits well on the test points.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multimodal behavior involves multiple processing stations distributed across
distant brain regions, but our understanding of how such distributed processing
is coordinated in the brain is limited. Here we take a decoding approach to
this problem, aiming to quantify how temporal aspects of brain-wide neural
activity may be used to infer specific multimodal behaviors. Using high
temporal resolution measurements by MEG, we detect bursts of activity from
hundreds of locations across the surface of the brain at millisecond
resolution. We then compare decoding using three characteristics of neural
activity bursts, decoding with event counts, with latencies and with time
differences between pairs of events. Training decoders in this regime is
particularly challenging because the number of samples is smaller by orders of
magnitude than the input dimensionality. We develop a new decoding approach for
this regime that combines non-parametric modelling with aggressive feature
selection. Surprisingly, we find that decoding using time-differences, based on
thousands of region pairs, is significantly more accurate than using other
activity characteristics, reaching 90% accuracy consistently across subjects.
These results suggest that relevant information about multimodal brain function
is provided by subtle time differences across remote brain areas.

	<description>Loss of sensory hair cells leads to deafness and balance deficiencies. In contrast to mammalian hair cells, zebrafish ear and lateral line hair cells regenerate from poorly characterized support cells. Equally ill-defined is the gene regulatory network underlying the progression of support cells to differentiated hair cells. scRNA-Seq of lateral line organs uncovered five different support cell types, including quiescent and activated stem cells. Ordering of support cells along a developmental trajectory identified self-renewing cells and genes required for hair cell differentiation. scRNA-Seq analyses of &lt;i&gt;fgf3&lt;/i&gt; mutants, in which hair cell regeneration is increased, demonstrates that Fgf and Notch signaling inhibit proliferation of support cells in parallel by inhibiting Wnt signaling. Our scRNA-Seq analyses set the foundation for mechanistic studies of sensory organ regeneration and is crucial for identifying factors to trigger hair cell production in mammals. The data is searchable and publicly accessible via a web-based interface.</description>

Phototrophic organisms such as cyanobacteria utilize the sun’s energy to convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic carbon, resulting in diurnal variations in the cell’s metabolism. Flux balance analysis is a widely accepted constraint-based optimization tool for analyzing growth and metabolism, but it is generally used in a time-invariant manner with no provisions for sequestering different biomass components at different time periods. Here we present CycleSyn, a periodic model of &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt; sp. PCC 6803 metabolism that spans a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle by segmenting it into 12 Time Point Models (TPMs) with a uniform duration of two hours. The developed framework allows for the flow of metabolites across TPMs while inventorying metabolite levels and only allowing for the utilization of currently or previously produced compounds. The 12 TPMs allow for the incorporation of time-dependent constraints that capture the cyclic nature of cellular processes. Imposing bounds on reactions informed by temporally-segmented transcriptomic data enables simulation of phototrophic growth as a single linear programming (LP) problem. The solution provides the time varying reaction fluxes over a 24-hour cycle and the accumulation/consumption of metabolites. The diurnal rhythm of metabolic gene expression driven by the circadian clock and its metabolic consequences is explored. Predicted flux and metabolite pools are in line with published studies regarding the temporal organization of phototrophic growth in &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt; PCC 6803 paving the way for constructing time-resolved genome-scale models (GSMs) for organisms with a circadian clock. In addition, the metabolic reorganization that would be required to enable &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt; PCC 6803 to temporally separate photosynthesis from oxygen-sensitive nitrogen fixation is also explored using the developed model formalism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TnrMxUFOeR0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The differential modulation of agonist and antagonist binding to opioid receptors (ORs) by sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) has been known for decades. To shed light on the molecular determinants, thermodynamics, and kinetics of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; translocation through the μ-OR (MOR), we used a multi-ensemble Markov model framework combining equilibrium and non-equilibrium atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; binding to MOR active or inactive crystal structures embedded in an explicit lipid bilayer. We identify an energetically favorable, continuous ion pathway through the MOR active conformation only, and provide, for the first time: i) estimates of the energy differences and required timescales of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; translocation in inactive and active MORs, ii) estimates of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced changes to agonist binding validated by radioligand measurements, and iii) testable hypotheses of molecular determinants and correlated motions involved in this translocation, which are likely to play a key role in MOR signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vAvW0Pod-dQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cellular functions are shaped by reaction networks whose dynamics are determined by the concentrations of underlying components. However, cellular mechanisms ensuring that a component’s concentration resides in a given range remain elusive. We present network properties which suffice to identify components whose concentration ranges can be efficiently computed in mass-action metabolic networks. We show that the derived ranges are in excellent agreement with simulations from a detailed kinetic metabolic model of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that the approach can be used with genome-scale metabolic models to arrive at predictions concordant with measurements from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; under different growth scenarios. By application to 14 genome-scale metabolic models from diverse species, our approach specifies the cellular determinants of concentration ranges that can be effectively employed to make predictions for a variety of biotechnological and medical applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kQAXSW7n2UI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Systems biology reveals how altered TGFβ signalling with age reduces protection against pro-inflammatory stimuli</title>

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative condition caused by dysregulation of multiple molecular signalling pathways. Such dysregulation results in damage to cartilage, a smooth and protective tissue that enables low friction articulation of synovial joints. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-13, are key enzymes in the cleavage of type II collagen which is a vital component for cartilage integrity. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) can protect against pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated MMP expression. With age there is a change in the ratio of two TGFβ type I receptors (Alk1/Alk5), a shift that results in TGFβ losing its protective role in cartilage homeostasis. Instead, TGFβ promotes cartilage degradation which correlates with the spontaneous development of OA in murine models. However, the mechanism by which TGFβ protects against pro-inflammatory responses and how this changes with age has not been extensively studied. As TGFβ signalling is complex, we used systems biology to combine experimental and computational outputs to examine how the system changes with age. Experiments showed that the repressive effect of TGFβ on chondrocytes treated with a pro-inflammatory stimulus required Alk5. Computational modelling revealed two independent mechanisms were needed to explain the crosstalk between TGFβ and pro-inflammatory signalling pathways. A novel meta-analysis of microarray data from OA patient tissue was used to create a Cytoscape network representative of human OA and revealed the importance of inflammation. Combining the modelled genes with the microarray network provided a global overview into the crosstalk between the different signalling pathways involved in OA development.
Our results provide further insights into the mechanisms that cause TGFβ signalling to change from a protective to a detrimental pathway in cartilage with ageing. Moreover, such a systems biology approach may enable restoration of the protective role of TGFβ as a potential therapy to prevent age-related loss of cartilage and the development of OA.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/djeTM0j7Dos&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Gene regulatory networks are composed of sub-networks that are often shared across biological processes, cell-types, and organisms. Leveraging multiple sources of information, such as publicly available gene expression datasets, could therefore be helpful when learning a network of interest. Integrating data across different studies, however, raises numerous technical concerns. Hence, a common approach in network inference, and broadly in genomics research, is to separately learn models from each dataset and combine the results. Individual models, however, often suffer from under-sampling, poor generalization and limited network recovery. In this study, we explore previous integration strategies, such as batch-correction and model ensembles, and introduce a new multitask learning approach for joint network inference across several datasets. Our method initially estimates the activities of transcription factors, and subsequently, infers the relevant network topology. As regulatory interactions are context-dependent, we estimate model coefficients as a combination of both dataset-specific and conserved components. In addition, adaptive penalties may be used to favor models that include interactions derived from multiple sources of prior knowledge including orthogonal genomics experiments. We evaluate generalization and network recovery using examples from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, and show that sharing information across models improves network reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate robustness to both false positives in the prior information and heterogeneity among datasets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sm0qtCLgIJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Ten simple rules for writing statistical book reviews</title>

Statistical books can provide deep insights into statistics and software. There are, however, many resources available to the practitioner. Book reviews have the capacity to function as a critical mechanism for the learner to assess the merits of engaging in part, in full, or at all with a book. The “ten simple rules” format, pioneered in computational biology, was applied here to writing effective book reviews for statistics because of the wide breadth of offerings in this domain, including topical introductions, computational solutions, and theory. Learning by doing is a popular paradigm in statistics and computation, but there is still a niche for books in the pedagogy of self-taught and instruction-based learning. Primarily, these rules ensure that book reviews function as a form of short syntheses to inform and guide readers in deciding to use a specific book relative to other options for resolving statistical challenges.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u6I3i7zGdDw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: An Efficient Population Density Method for Modeling Neural Networks with Synaptic Dynamics Manifesting Finite Relaxation Time and Short-Term Plasticity</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;When incorporating more realistic synaptic dynamics, the computational efficiency of population density methods (PDMs) declines sharply due to the increase in the dimension of master equations. To avoid such a decline, we develop an efficient PDM, termed colored-synapse PDM (csPDM), in which the dimension of the master equations does not depend on the number of synapse-associated state variables in the underlying network model. Our goal is to allow the PDM to incorporate realistic synaptic dynamics that possesses not only finite relaxation time but also short-term plasticity (STP). The model equations of csPDM are derived based on the diffusion approximation on synaptic dynamics and probability density function methods for Langevin equations with colored noise. Numerical examples, given by simulations of the population dynamics of uncoupled exponential integrate-and-fire (EIF) neurons, show good agreement between the results of csPDM and Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs). Compared to the original full-dimensional PDM (fdPDM), the csPDM reveals more excellent computational efficiency because of the lower dimension of the master equations. In addition, it permits network dynamics to possess the short-term plastic characteristics inherited from plastic synapses. The novel csPDM has potential applicability to any spiking neuron models because of no assumptions on neuronal dynamics, and, more importantly, this is the first report of PDM to successfully encompass short-term facilitation/depression properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The free energy principle has been proposed as a unifying theory of brain
function. It is closely related, and in some cases subsumes, earlier unifying
ideas such as Bayesian inference, predictive coding, and active learning. This
article clarifies these connections, teasing apart distinctive and shared
predictions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Finding the causes to observed effects and establishing causal relationships
between events is (and has been) an essential element of science and
philosophy. Automated methods that can detect causal relationships would be
very welcome, but practical methods that can infer causality are difficult to
find, and the subject of ongoing research. While Shannon information only
detects correlation, there are several information-theoretic notions of
&quot;directed information&quot; that have successfully detected causality in some
systems, in particular in the neuroscience community. However, recent work has
shown that some directed information measures can sometimes inadequately
estimate the extent of causal relations, or even fail to identify existing
cause-effect relations between components of systems, especially if neurons
contribute in a cryptographic manner to influence the effector neuron. Here, we
test how often cryptographic logic emerges in an evolutionary process that
generates artificial neural circuits for two fundamental cognitive tasks:
motion detection and sound localization. Our results suggest that whether or
not transfer entropy measures of causality are misleading depends strongly on
the cognitive task considered. These results emphasize the importance of
understanding the fundamental logic processes that contribute to cognitive
processing, and quantifying their relevance in any given nervous system.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The control of brain network dynamics across diverse scales of space and time. (arXiv:1901.07536v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is composed of distinct regions that are each associated with
particular functions and distinct propensities for the control of neural
dynamics. However, the relation between these functions and control profiles is
poorly understood, as is the variation in this relation across diverse scales
of space and time. Here we probe the relation between control and dynamics in
brain networks constructed from diffusion tensor imaging data in a large
community based sample of young adults. Specifically, we probe the control
properties of each brain region and investigate their relationship with
dynamics across various spatial scales using the Laplacian eigenspectrum. In
addition, through analysis of regional modal controllability and partitioning
of modes, we determine whether the associated dynamics are fast or slow, as
well as whether they are alternating or monotone. We find that brain regions
that facilitate the control of energetically easy transitions are associated
with activity on short length scales and fast time scales. Conversely, brain
regions that facilitate control of difficult transitions are associated with
activity on long length scales and slow time scales. Built on linear dynamical
models, our results offer parsimonious explanations for the activity
propagation and network control profiles supported by regions of differing
neuroanatomical structure.

	<description>Conflicting reports about whether adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs in humans raise questions about its significance for human health and the relevance of animal models. Drawing upon published data, I review species’ neurogenesis rates across the lifespan and propose that accelerated neurodevelopmental timing is consistent with lower rates of neurogenesis in adult primates and humans. Nonetheless, protracted neurogenesis may produce populations of neurons that retain plastic properties for long intervals, and have distinct functions depending on when in the lifespan they were born.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Epithelial stratification shapes infection dynamics</title>

Infections of stratified epithelia contribute to a large group of common diseases, such as dermatological conditions and sexually transmitted diseases. To investigate how epithelial structure affects infection dynamics, we develop a general ecology-inspired model for stratified epithelia. Our model allows us to simulate infections, explore new hypotheses and estimate parameters that are difficult to measure with tissue cell cultures. We focus on two contrasting pathogens: &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; and Human papillomaviruses. Using cervicovaginal parameter estimates, we find that key infection symptoms can be explained by differential interactions with the layers, while clearance and pathogen burden appear to be bottom-up processes. Cell protective responses to infections (e.g. mucus trapping) generally lowered pathogen load but there were specific effects based on infection strategies. Our modeling approach opens new perspectives for 3D tissue culture experimental systems of infections and, more generally, for developing and testing hypotheses related to infections of stratified epithelia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ztnxRVtKRWQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Although the basic cellular organization of the cortex is conserved across mammals, cells have diversified during evolution. An increasingly integrated taxonomy of cell types, especially with the advent of single-cell transcriptomic data, has revealed an unprecedented variety of human cortical cell subtypes. Here, we broadly review the cellular composition and diversity of the mammalian brain, and how progenitor pools generate cell subtypes during development. We then discuss human cortical cells that are distinct from rodent cells, as well as the challenges and advantages of using model systems to study human cell types in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Quantitative information on protein lifetimes can provide clues as to how these challenges are met. Advances in proteomics and mass spectrometry, which now enable comprehensive lifetime estimations for thousands of proteins, suggest that neuronal and synaptic protein lifetimes are unusually long, with half-lives typically ranging from days to weeks, even months and beyond for certain protein families. Half-lives &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; are several-fold longer than those in cell culture, tend to cluster for proteins belonging to multimolecular complexes, are affected by developmental stage, and possibly by environmental conditions and activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Alzheimer's Disease Risk Factor Pyk2 Mediates Amyloid-{beta}-Induced Synaptic Dysfunction and Loss</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/758?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/758?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dozens of genes have been implicated in late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but none has a defined mechanism of action in neurons. Here, we show that the risk factor Pyk2 (PTK2B) localizes specifically to neurons in adult brain. Absence of Pyk2 has no major effect on synapse formation or the basal parameters of synaptic transmission in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway. However, the induction of synaptic LTD is suppressed in Pyk2-null slices. In contrast, deletion of Pyk2 expression does not alter LTP under control conditions. Of relevance for AD pathophysiology, Pyk2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; slices are protected from amyloid-β-oligomer (Aβo)-induced suppression of LTP in hippocampal slices. Acutely, a Pyk2 kinase inhibitor also prevents Aβo-induced suppression of LTP in WT slices. Female and male transgenic AD model mice expressing APPswe/PSEN1E9 require Pyk2 for age-dependent loss of synaptic markers and for impairment of learning and memory. However, absence of Pyk2 does not alter Aβ accumulation or gliosis. Therefore, the Pyk2 risk gene is directly implicated in a neuronal Aβo signaling pathway impairing synaptic anatomy and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Genetic variation at the Pyk2 (PTK2B) locus is a risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the pathophysiological role of Pyk2 is not clear. Here, we studied Pyk2 neuronal function in mice lacking expression with and without transgenes generating amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque pathology. Pyk2 is not required for basal synaptic transmission or LTP, but participates in LTD. Hippocampal slices lacking Pyk2 are protected from AD-related Aβ oligomer suppression of synaptic plasticity. In transgenic AD model mice, deletion of Pyk2 rescues synaptic loss and learning/memory deficits. Therefore, Pyk2 plays a central role in AD-related synaptic dysfunction mediating Aβ-triggered dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Claudin-1-Dependent Destabilization of the Blood-Brain Barrier in Chronic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/743?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/743?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence suggests that blood–brain barrier (BBB) recovery and reestablishment of BBB impermeability after stroke is incomplete. This could influence stroke recovery, increase the risk of repeat stroke, and be a solid substrate for developing vascular dementia. Although accumulating evidence has defined morphological alterations and underlying mechanisms of tight junction (TJ) changes during BBB breakdown in acute stroke, very little is known about the type of alterations and mechanisms in BBB &quot;leakage&quot; found subacutely or chronically. The current study examined BBB structural alterations during the &quot;BBB leakage&quot; associated with the chronic phase of stroke in male mice and both genders of humans. We found significant upregulation of claudin-1 mRNA and protein, a nonspecific claudin for blood vessels, and downregulation in claudin-5 expression. Morphological and biochemical as well as fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of postischemic brain endothelial cells and cells overexpressing claudin-1 indicated that newly synthesized claudin-1 was present on the cell membrane (~45%), was incorporated into the TJ complex with established interaction with zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and was building homophilic &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-interactions. The appearance of claudin-1 in the TJ complex reduced claudin-5 strands (homophilic claudin-5 &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-interactions) and claudin-5/ZO-1 interaction affecting claudin-5 incorporation into the TJ complex. Moreover, claudin-1 induction was associated with an endothelial proinflammatory phenotype. Targeting claudin-1 with a specific C1C2 peptide improved brain endothelial barrier permeability and functional recovery in chronic stroke condition. This study highlights a potential &quot;defect&quot; in postischemic barrier formation that may underlie prolonged vessel leakiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although rarely expressed at the normal blood–brain barrier (BBB), claudin-1 is expressed in pathological conditions. Analyzing poststroke human and mouse blood microvessels we have identified that claudin-1 is highly expressed in leaky brain microvessels. Our results reveal that claudin-1 is incorporated in BBB tight junction complex, impeding BBB recovery and causing BBB leakiness during poststroke recovery. Targeting claudin-1 with a claudin-1 peptide improves brain endothelial barrier permeability and consequently functional neurological recovery after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Knock-out of mGluR5 from Astrocytes during Epilepsy Development Impairs High-Frequency Glutamate Uptake</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/727?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/727?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocyte expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is consistently observed in resected tissue from patients with epilepsy and is equally prevalent in animal models of epilepsy. However, little is known about the functional signaling properties or downstream consequences of astrocyte mGluR5 activation during epilepsy development. In the rodent brain, astrocyte mGluR5 expression is developmentally regulated and confined in expression/function to the first weeks of life, with similar observations made in human control tissue. Herein, we demonstrate that mGluR5 expression and function dramatically increase in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Interestingly, in both male and female mice, mGluR5 function persists in the astrocyte throughout the process of epileptogenesis following status epilepticus. However, mGluR5 expression and function are transient in animals that do not develop epilepsy over an equivalent time period, suggesting that patterns of mGluR5 expression may signify continuing epilepsy development or its resolution. We demonstrate that, during epileptogenesis, astrocytes reacquire mGluR5-dependent calcium transients following agonist application or synaptic glutamate release, a feature of astrocyte-neuron communication absent since early development. Finally, we find that the selective and conditional knock-out of mGluR5 signaling from astrocytes during epilepsy development slows the rate of glutamate clearance through astrocyte glutamate transporters under high-frequency stimulation conditions, a feature that suggests astrocyte mGluR5 expression during epileptogenesis may recapitulate earlier developmental roles in regulating glutamate transporter function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In development, astrocyte mGluR5 signaling plays a critical role in regulating structural and functional interactions between astrocytes and neurons at the tripartite synapse. Notably, mGluR5 signaling is a positive regulator of astrocyte glutamate transporter expression and function, an essential component of excitatory signaling regulation in hippocampus. After early development, astrocyte mGluR5 expression is downregulated, but reemerges in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) development and patient epilepsy samples. We explored the hypothesis that astrocyte mGluR5 reemergence recapitulates earlier developmental roles during TLE acquisition. Our work demonstrates that astrocytes with mGluR5 signaling during TLE development perform faster glutamate uptake in hippocampus, revealing a previously unexplored role for astrocyte mGluR5 signaling in hypersynchronous pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hard Decisions Shape the Neural Coding of Preferences</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/718?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/718?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hard decisions between equally valued alternatives can result in preference changes, meaning that subsequent valuations for chosen items increase and decrease for rejected items. Previous research suggests that this phenomenon is a consequence of cognitive dissonance reduction after the decision, induced by the mismatch between initial preferences and decision outcomes. In contrast, this functional magnetic resonance imaging and eye-tracking study with male and female human participants found that preferences are already updated online during the process of decision-making. Preference changes were predicted from activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and precuneus while making hard decisions. Fixation durations during this phase predicted both choice outcomes and subsequent preference changes. These preference adjustments became behaviorally relevant only for choices that were remembered and were in turn associated with hippocampus activity. Our results suggest that preferences evolve dynamically as decisions arise, potentially as a mechanism to prevent stalemate situations in underdetermined decision scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Most theories of decision-making assume that we always choose the best option available, based on a set of stable preferences. However, what happens for hard decisions when the available options are preferred equally? We show that in such stalemate situations, decision-makers adjust their preferences dynamically during the process of decision-making, and these preference adjustments are predicted by a left prefrontal-parietal network. We also show that eye movements during decision-making are predictive of the magnitude of the upcoming value change. Our results suggest that preferences are dynamic, adjusted every time a hard decision is made, prompting a re-evaluation of existing frameworks of decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Posterior-Anterior Distinction between Scene Perception and Scene Construction in Human Medial Parietal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/705?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/705?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human retrosplenial complex (RSC), located in medial parietal cortex, has been implicated in numerous cognitive functions, including scene perception, spatial navigation, and autobiographical memory retrieval. Recently, a posterior–anterior distinction within RSC was proposed, such that posterior aspects process scene-related visual information (constituting a medial place area [MPA]), whereas anterior aspects process information that is vividly retrieved from memory, thereby supporting remembering and potentially navigation. Here, we tested this proposed distinction in a single group of participants (both male and female) using fMRI with both perceptual and mnemonic tasks. After completing a resting-state scan, participants performed a task that required constructing scenes from memory and completed a scene selectivity localizer task. We tested directly perceptual and mnemonic responses in MPA and an anterior, connectivity-defined region (CON), which showed strong functional connectivity with anterior parahippocampal place area. A double dissociation was observed, such that CON was more strongly activated during scene construction than was MPA, whereas MPA was more perceptually responsive than CON. Further, peak responses from the scene construction task were anterior to perceptual peaks in all but 1 participant and hemisphere. Finally, through analyses of the posterior–anterior response profiles, we identify the fundus of the parieto-occipital sulcus as a potential location for the crossover from perceptual to mnemonic representations and highlight a potential left-hemisphere advantage for mnemonic representations. Collectively, our results support a distinction between posterior and anterior aspects of the RSC, suggesting that more specific functional-anatomic terms should be used in its place in future work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The retrosplenial complex (RSC) has been implicated in vision, spatial cognition, and memory. We previously speculated on a potential posterior–anterior distinction within RSC for scene perception and memory-based scene construction/navigation. Here, we tested this distinction through a combination of resting-state, perceptual, and mnemonic task data. Consistent with our predictions, we demonstrate that perceptual responses peak consistently posterior of those elicited by memory-based scene construction within the broader RSC. Further, we highlight (1) the fundus of the parieto-occipital sulcus as a landmark for the transition between these representations, (2) the anterior bank of parieto-occipital sulcus as the point of maximal separation between these representations, and (3) identify a potential hemispheric asymmetry in mnemonic representations. These data support functional dissociations within RSC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We now know that sensory processing in cortex occurs not only via direct communication between primary to secondary areas, but also via their parallel cortico-thalamo-cortical (i.e., &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic) pathways. Both corticocortical and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic pathways mainly signal through glutamatergic class 1 (driver) synapses, which have robust and efficient synaptic dynamics suited for the transfer of information such as receptive field properties, suggesting the importance of class 1 synapses in feedforward, hierarchical processing. However, such a parallel arrangement has only been identified in sensory cortical areas: visual, somatosensory, and auditory. To test the generality of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic pathways, we sought to establish its presence beyond purely sensory cortices to determine whether there is a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic pathway parallel to the established primary somatosensory (S1) to primary motor (M1) pathway. We used &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-synaptic viral tracing, optogenetics in slice preparations, and bouton size analysis in the mouse (both sexes) to document that a circuit exists from layer 5 of S1 through the posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus to M1 with glutamatergic class 1 properties. This represents a hitherto unknown, robust sensorimotor linkage and suggests that the arrangement of parallel direct and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic corticocortical circuits may be present as a general feature of cortical functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; During sensory processing, feedforward pathways carry information such as receptive field properties via glutamatergic class 1 synapses, which have robust and efficient synaptic dynamics. As expected, class 1 synapses subserve the feedforward projection from primary to secondary sensory cortex, but also a route through specific higher-order thalamic nuclei, creating a parallel feedforward &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic pathway. We now extend the concept of cortical areas being connected via parallel, direct, and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic circuits from purely sensory cortices to a sensorimotor cortical circuit (i.e., primary sensory cortex to primary motor cortex). This suggests a generalized arrangement for corticocortical communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Drebrin-like (Dbnl) Controls Neuronal Migration via Regulating N-Cadherin Expression in the Developing Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/678?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The actin cytoskeleton is crucial for neuronal migration in the mammalian developing cerebral cortex. The adaptor protein Drebrin-like (Dbnl) plays important roles in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, dendrite formation, and endocytosis by interacting with F-actin, cobl, and dynamin. Although Dbnl is known to be expressed in the brain, the functions of this molecule during brain development are largely unknown. In this study, to examine the roles of Dbnl in the developing cerebral cortex, we conducted experiments using mice of both sexes with knockdown of Dbnl, effected by &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; electroporation, in the migrating neurons of the embryonic cortex. Time-lapse imaging of the Dbnl-knockdown neurons revealed that the presence of Dbnl is a prerequisite for appropriate formation of processes in the multipolar neurons in the multipolar cell accumulation zone or the deep part of the subventricular zone, and for neuronal polarization and entry into the cortical plate. We found that Dbnl knockdown decreased the amount of N-cadherin protein expressed on the plasma membrane of the cortical neurons. The defect in neuronal migration caused by Dbnl knockdown was rescued by moderate overexpression of N-cadherin and αN-catenin or by transfection of the phospho-mimic form (Y337E, Y347E), but not the phospho-resistant form (Y337F, Y347F), of Dbnl. These results suggest that Dbnl controls neuronal migration, neuronal multipolar morphology, and cell polarity in the developing cerebral cortex via regulating N-cadherin expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Disruption of neuronal migration can cause neuronal disorders, such as lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia. During cerebral cortical development, the actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in neuronal migration; however, the mechanisms of regulation of neuronal migration by the actin cytoskeleton still remain unclear. Herein, we report that the novel protein Dbnl, an actin-binding protein, controls multiple events during neuronal migration in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. We also showed that this regulation is mediated by phosphorylation of Dbnl at tyrosine residues 337 and 347 and αN-catenin/N-cadherin, suggesting that the Dbnl-αN-catenin/N-cadherin pathway is important for neuronal migration in the developing cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Local Acceleration of Neurofilament Transport at Nodes of Ranvier</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/663?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Myelinated axons are constricted at nodes of Ranvier. These constrictions are important physiologically because they increase the speed of saltatory nerve conduction, but they also represent potential bottlenecks for the movement of axonally transported cargoes. One type of cargo are neurofilaments, which are abundant space-filling cytoskeletal polymers that function to increase axon caliber. Neurofilaments move bidirectionally along axons, alternating between rapid movements and prolonged pauses. Strikingly, axon constriction at nodes is accompanied by a reduction in neurofilament number that can be as much as 10-fold in the largest axons. To investigate how neurofilaments navigate these constrictions, we developed a transgenic mouse strain that expresses a photoactivatable fluorescent neurofilament protein in neurons. We used the pulse-escape fluorescence photoactivation technique to analyze neurofilament transport in mature myelinated axons of tibial nerves from male and female mice of this strain &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Fluorescent neurofilaments departed the activated region more rapidly in nodes than in flanking internodes, indicating that neurofilament transport is faster in nodes. By computational modeling, we showed that this nodal acceleration can be explained largely by a local increase in the duty cycle of neurofilament transport (i.e., the proportion of the time that the neurofilaments spend moving). We propose that this transient acceleration functions to maintain a constant neurofilament flux across nodal constrictions, much as the current increases where a river narrows its banks. In this way, neurofilaments are prevented from piling up in the flanking internodes, ensuring a stable neurofilament distribution and uniform axonal morphology across these physiologically important axonal domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Myelinated axons are constricted at nodes of Ranvier, resulting in a marked local decrease in neurofilament number. These constrictions are important physiologically because they increase the efficiency of saltatory nerve conduction, but they also represent potential bottlenecks for the axonal transport of neurofilaments, which move along axons in a rapid intermittent manner. Imaging of neurofilament transport in mature myelinated axons &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; reveals that neurofilament polymers navigate these nodal axonal constrictions by accelerating transiently, much as the current increases where a river narrows its banks. This local acceleration is necessary to ensure a stable axonal morphology across nodal constrictions, which may explain the vulnerability of nodes of Ranvier to neurofilament accumulations in animal models of neurotoxic neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Localizing Proton-Mediated Inhibitory Feedback at the Retinal Horizontal Cell-Cone Synapse with Genetically-Encoded pH Probes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/651?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/651?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Lateral inhibition in the vertebrate retina depends on a negative feedback synapse between horizontal cells (HCs) and rod and cone photoreceptors. A change in pH is thought to be the signal for negative feedback, but its spatial profile in the synaptic cleft is unknown. Here we use three different membrane proteins, each fused to the same genetically-encoded pH-sensitive Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) (pHluorin), to probe synaptic pH in retina from transgenic zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;) of either sex. We used the cone transducin promoter to express SynaptopHluorin (pHluorin on vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP2)) or CalipHluorin (pHluorin on an L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel) and the HC-specific connexin-55.5 promoter to express AMPApHluorin (pHluorin on an AMPA receptor). Stimulus light led to increased fluorescence of all three probes, consistent with alkalinization of the synaptic cleft. The receptive field size, sensitivity to surround illumination, and response to activation of an alien receptor expressed exclusively in HCs, are consistent with lateral inhibition as the trigger for alkalinization. However, SynaptopHluorin and AMPApHluorin, which are displaced farther from cone synaptic ribbons than CalipHluorin, reported a smaller pH change. Hence, unlike feedforward glutamatergic transmission, which spills over to allow cross talk between terminals in the cone network, the pH change underlying HC feedback is compartmentalized to individual synaptic invaginations within a cone terminal, consistent with private line communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Lateral inhibition (LI) is a fundamental feature of information processing in sensory systems, enhancing contrast sensitivity and enabling edge discrimination. Horizontal cells (HCs) are the first cellular substrate of LI in the vertebrate retina, but the synaptic mechanisms underlying LI are not completely understood, despite decades of study. This paper makes a significant contribution to our understanding of LI, by showing that each HC–cone synapse is a &quot;private-line&quot; that operates independently from other HC–cone connections. Using transgenic zebrafish expressing pHluorin, a pH-sensitive GFP variant spliced onto three different protein platforms expressed either in cones or HCs we show that the feedback pH signal is constrained to individual cone terminals, and more stringently, to individual synaptic contact sites within each terminal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Extrasynaptic NMDA Receptors on Rod Pathway Amacrine Cells: Molecular Composition, Activation, and Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/627?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/627?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the rod pathway of the mammalian retina, axon terminals of glutamatergic rod bipolar cells are presynaptic to AII and A17 amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer. Recent evidence suggests that both amacrines express NMDA receptors, raising questions concerning molecular composition, localization, activation, and function of these receptors. Using dual patch-clamp recording from synaptically connected rod bipolar and AII or A17 amacrine cells in retinal slices from female rats, we found no evidence that NMDA receptors contribute to postsynaptic currents evoked in either amacrine. Instead, NMDA receptors on both amacrine cells were activated by ambient glutamate, and blocking glutamate uptake increased their level of activation. NMDA receptor activation also increased the frequency of GABAergic postsynaptic currents in rod bipolar cells, suggesting that NMDA receptors can drive release of GABA from A17 amacrines. A striking dichotomy was revealed by pharmacological and immunolabeling experiments, which found GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors on AII amacrines and GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors on A17 amacrines. Immunolabeling also revealed a clustered organization of NMDA receptors on both amacrines and a close spatial association between GluN2B subunits and connexin 36 on AII amacrines, suggesting that NMDA receptor modulation of gap junction coupling between these cells involves the GluN2B subunit. Using multiphoton Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging, we verified that activation of NMDA receptors evoked an increase of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in dendrites of both amacrines. Our results suggest that AII and A17 amacrines express clustered, extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, with different and complementary subunits that are likely to contribute differentially to signal processing and plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Glutamate is the most important excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, but not all glutamate receptors transmit fast excitatory signals at synapses. NMDA-type glutamate receptors act as voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels, with functional properties determined by their specific subunit composition. These receptors can be found at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites on neurons, but the role of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that retinal AII and A17 amacrine cells, postsynaptic partners at rod bipolar dyad synapses, express extrasynaptic (but not synaptic) NMDA receptors, with different and complementary GluN2 subunits. The localization of GluN2A-containing receptors to A17s and GluN2B-containing receptors to AIIs suggests a mechanism for differential modulation of excitability and signaling in this retinal microcircuit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Enhancement of BDNF Expression and Memory by HDAC Inhibition Requires BET Bromodomain Reader Proteins</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/612?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may have therapeutic utility in multiple neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify BRD4, a BET bromodomain reader of acetyl-lysine histones, as an essential component involved in potentiated expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and memory following HDAC inhibition. In &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies, we reveal that pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 reversed the increase in &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; mRNA induced by the class I/IIb HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). Knock-down of HDAC2 and HDAC3, but not other HDACs, increased &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression, whereas knock-down of BRD4 blocked these effects. Using dCas9-BRD4, locus-specific targeting of BRD4 to the &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; promoter increased &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. In additional studies, RGFP966, a pharmacological inhibitor of HDAC3, elevated &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; expression and BRD4 binding to the BDNF promoter, effects that were abrogated by JQ1 (an inhibitor of BRD4). Examining known epigenetic targets of BRD4 and HDAC3, we show that H4K5ac and H4K8ac modifications and H4K5ac enrichment at the &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; promoter were elevated following RGFP966 treatment. In electrophysiological studies, JQ1 reversed RGFP966-induced enhancement of LTP in hippocampal slice preparations. Last, in behavioral studies, RGFP966 increased subthreshold novel object recognition memory and cocaine place preference in male C57BL/6 mice, effects that were reversed by cotreatment with JQ1. Together, these data reveal that BRD4 plays a key role in HDAC3 inhibitor-induced potentiation of &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; expression, neuroplasticity, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Some histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are known to have neuroprotective and cognition-enhancing properties, but the underlying mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we reveal that BRD4, an epigenetic reader of histone acetylation marks, is necessary for enhancing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and improved memory following HDAC inhibition. Therefore, by identifying novel epigenetic regulators of BDNF expression, these data may lead to new therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modulator-Gated, SUMOylation-Mediated, Activity-Dependent Regulation of Ionic Current Densities Contributes to Short-Term Activity Homeostasis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/596?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons operate within defined activity limits, and feedback control mechanisms dynamically tune ionic currents to maintain this optimal range. This study describes a novel, rapid feedback mechanism that uses SUMOylation to continuously adjust ionic current densities according to changes in activity. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a peptide that can be post-translationally conjugated to ion channels to influence their surface expression and biophysical properties. Neuronal activity can regulate the extent of protein SUMOylation. This study on the single, unambiguously identifiable lateral pyloric neuron (LP), a component of the pyloric network in the stomatogastric nervous system of male and female spiny lobsters (&lt;i&gt;Panulirus interruptus&lt;/i&gt;), focused on dynamic SUMOylation in the context of activity homeostasis. There were four major findings: First, neuronal activity adjusted the balance between SUMO conjugation and deconjugation to continuously and bidirectionally fine-tune the densities of two opposing conductances: the hyperpolarization activated current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) and the transient potassium current (I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;). Second, tonic 5 nm dopamine (DA) gated activity-dependent SUMOylation to permit and prevent activity-dependent regulation of I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Third, DA-gated, activity-dependent SUMOylation contributed to a feedback mechanism that restored the timing and duration of LP activity during prolonged modulation by 5 μm DA, which initially altered these and other activity features. Fourth, DA modulatory and metamoduatory (gating) effects were tailored to simultaneously alter and stabilize neuronal output. Our findings suggest that modulatory tone may select a subset of rapid activity-dependent mechanisms from a larger menu to achieve homeostasis under varying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Post-translational SUMOylation of ion channel subunits controls their interactions. When subunit SUMOylation is dysregulated, conductance densities mediated by the channels are distorted, leading to nervous system disorders, such as seizures and chronic pain. Regulation of ion channel SUMOylation is poorly understood. This study demonstrated that neuronal activity can regulate SUMOylation to reconfigure ionic current densities over minutes, and this regulation was gated by tonic nanomolar dopamine. Dynamic SUMOylation was necessary to maintain specific aspects of neuronal output while the neuron was being modulated by high (5 μm) concentrations of dopamine, suggesting that the gating function may ensure neuronal homeostasis during extrinsic modulation of a circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Coincidence Detection within the Excitable Rat Olfactory Bulb Granule Cell Spines</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/584?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/584?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the mammalian olfactory bulb, the inhibitory axonless granule cells (GCs) feature reciprocal synapses that interconnect them with the principal neurons of the bulb, mitral, and tufted cells. These synapses are located within large excitable spines that can generate local action potentials (APs) upon synaptic input (&quot;spine spike&quot;). Moreover, GCs can fire global APs that propagate throughout the dendrite. Strikingly, local postsynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry summates mostly linearly with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry due to coincident global APs generated by glomerular stimulation, although some underlying conductances should be inactivated. We investigated this phenomenon by constructing a compartmental GC model to simulate the pairing of local and global signals as a function of their temporal separation t. These simulations yield strongly sublinear summation of spine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry for the case of perfect coincidence t = 0 ms. Summation efficiency (SE) sharply rises for both positive and negative t. The SE reduction for coincident signals depends on the presence of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in the spine head, while NMDARs are not essential. We experimentally validated the simulated SE in slices of juvenile rat brain (both sexes) by pairing two-photon uncaging of glutamate at spines and APs evoked by somatic current injection at various intervals t while imaging spine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Finally, the latencies of synaptically evoked global APs and EPSPs were found to correspond to t  10 ms, explaining the observed approximately linear summation of synaptic local and global signals. Our results provide additional evidence for the existence of the GC spine spike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we investigate the interaction of local synaptic inputs and global activation of a neuron by a backpropagating action potential within a dendritic spine with respect to local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. Our system of interest, the reciprocal spine of the olfactory bulb granule cell, is known to feature a special processing mode, namely, a synaptically triggered action potential that is restricted to the spine head. Therefore, coincidence detection of local and global signals follows different rules than in more conventional synapses. We unravel these rules using both simulations and experiments and find that signals coincident within ±7 ms around 0 ms result in sublinear summation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry because of synaptic activation of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels within the spine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce Arbor, a performance portable library for simulation of large
networks of multi-compartment neurons on HPC systems. Arbor is open source
software, developed under the auspices of the HBP. The performance portability
is by virtue of back-end specific optimizations for x86 multicore, Intel KNL,
and NVIDIA GPUs. When coupled with low memory overheads, these optimizations
make Arbor an order of magnitude faster than the most widely-used comparable
simulation software. The single-node performance can be scaled out to run very
large models at extreme scale with efficient weak scaling.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many time-series data including text, movies, and biological signals can be
represented as sequences of correlated binary patterns. These patterns may be
described by weighted combinations of a few dominant structures that underpin
specific interactions among the binary elements. To extract the dominant
correlation structures and their contributions to generating data in a
time-dependent manner, we model the dynamics of binary patterns using the
state-space model of an Ising-type network that is composed of multiple
undirected graphs. We provide a sequential Bayes algorithm to estimate the
dynamics of weights on the graphs while gaining the graph structures online.
This model can uncover overlapping graphs underlying the data better than a
traditional orthogonal decomposition method, and outperforms an original
time-dependent full Ising model. We assess the performance of the method by
simulated data, and demonstrate that spontaneous activity of cultured
hippocampal neurons is represented by dynamics of multiple graphs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) remain at risk for
neurodevelopmental impairment despite improved peri- and intraoperative care.
Our prospective cohort study aimed to determine the relationship between
perioperative brain volumes and neurodevelopmental outcome in neonates with
severe CHD. Pre- and postoperative cerebral MRI was acquired in term born
neonates with CHD undergoing neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Brain
volumes were measured using an atlas prior based automated method. One-year
outcome was assessed with the Bayley-III. CHD infants (n=77) had lower pre- and
postoper-ative total and regional brain volumes compared to controls (n=44, all
p&amp;lt;0.01). CHD infants had poorer cognitive and motor outcome (p&amp;lt;=0.0001) and a
trend towards lower language composite score compared to controls (p=0.06). The
total and selected regional postoperative brain volumes predicted cognitive and
language outcome (all p&amp;lt;0.04). This association was independent of length of
intensive care unit stay for total, cortical, temporal, frontal and cerebellar
volumes. In CHD neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, pre- and
postoperative brain volumes are reduced, and postoperative brain volumes
predict cognitive and language outcome at one year. Reduced cerebral volumes in
CHD patients could serve as a biomarker for im-paired outcome.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) allows information to be stored and manipulated over
short time scales. Performance on WM tasks is thought to be supported by the
frontoparietal system (FPS), the default mode system (DMS), and interactions
between them. Yet little is known about how these systems and their
interactions relate to individual differences in WM performance. We address
this gap in knowledge using functional MRI data acquired during the performance
of a 2-back WM task, as well as diffusion tensor imaging data collected in the
same individuals. We show that the strength of functional interactions between
the FPS and DMS during task engagement is inversely correlated with WM
performance, and that this strength is modulated by the activation of FPS
regions but not DMS regions. Next, we use a clustering algorithm to identify
two distinct subnetworks of the FPS, and find that these subnetworks display
distinguishable patterns of gene expression. Activity in one subnetwork is
positively associated with the strength of FPS-DMS functional interactions,
while activity in the second subnetwork is negatively associated. Further, the
pattern of structural linkages of these subnetworks explains their differential
capacity to influence the strength of FPS-DMS functional interactions. To
determine whether these observations could provide a mechanistic account of
large-scale neural underpinnings of WM, we build a computational model of the
system composed of coupled oscillators. Modulating the amplitude of the
subnetworks in the model causes the expected change in the strength of FPS-DMS
functional interactions, thereby offering support for a mechanism in which
subnetwork activity tunes functional interactions. Broadly, our study presents
a holistic account of how regional activity, functional interactions, and
structural linkages together support individual differences in WM in humans.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A Gestalt inference model for auditory scene segregation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Debmalya Chakrabarty, Mounya Elhilali&lt;/p&gt;

Our current understanding of how the brain segregates auditory scenes into meaningful objects is in line with a Gestaltism framework. These Gestalt principles suggest a theory of how different attributes of the soundscape are extracted then bound together into separate groups that reflect different objects or streams present in the scene. These cues are thought to reflect the underlying statistical structure of natural sounds in a similar way that statistics of natural images are closely linked to the principles that guide figure-ground segregation and object segmentation in vision. In the present study, we leverage inference in stochastic neural networks to learn emergent grouping cues directly from natural soundscapes including speech, music and sounds in nature. The model learns a hierarchy of local and global spectro-temporal attributes reminiscent of simultaneous and sequential Gestalt cues that underlie the organization of auditory scenes. These mappings operate at multiple time scales to analyze an incoming complex scene and are then fused using a Hebbian network that binds together coherent features into perceptually-segregated auditory objects. The proposed architecture successfully emulates a wide range of well established auditory scene segregation phenomena and quantifies the complimentary role of segregation and binding cues in driving auditory scene segregation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vyBkEuhJkjY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Generalizing clusters of similar species as a signature of coexistence under competition</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael D’Andrea, Maria Riolo, Annette M. Ostling&lt;/p&gt;

Patterns of trait distribution among competing species can potentially reveal the processes that allow them to coexist. It has been recently proposed that competition may drive the spontaneous emergence of niches comprising clusters of similar species, in contrast with the dominant paradigm of greater-than-chance species differences. However, current clustering theory relies largely on heuristic rather than mechanistic models. Furthermore, studies of models incorporating demographic stochasticity and immigration, two key players in community assembly, did not observe clusters. Here we demonstrate clustering under partitioning of resources, partitioning of environmental gradients, and a competition-colonization tradeoff. We show that clusters are robust to demographic stochasticity, and can persist under immigration. While immigration may sustain clusters that are otherwise transient, too much dilutes the pattern. In order to detect and quantify clusters in nature, we introduce and validate metrics which have no free parameters nor require arbitrary trait binning, and weigh species by their abundances rather than relying on a presence-absence count. By generalizing beyond the circumstances where clusters have been observed, our study contributes to establishing them as an update to classical trait patterning theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IY4Xes5-Z1I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Top-down inputs drive neuronal network rewiring and context-enhanced sensory processing in olfaction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Wayne Adams, James N. Graham, Xuchen Han, Hermann Riecke&lt;/p&gt;

Much of the computational power of the mammalian brain arises from its extensive top-down projections. To enable neuron-specific information processing these projections have to be precisely targeted. How such a specific connectivity emerges and what functions it supports is still poorly understood. We addressed these questions in silico in the context of the profound structural plasticity of the olfactory system. At the core of this plasticity are the granule cells of the olfactory bulb, which integrate bottom-up sensory inputs and top-down inputs delivered by vast top-down projections from cortical and other brain areas. We developed a biophysically supported computational model for the rewiring of the top-down projections and the intra-bulbar network via adult neurogenesis. The model captures various previous physiological and behavioral observations and makes specific predictions for the cortico-bulbar network connectivity that is learned by odor exposure and environmental contexts. Specifically, it predicts that—after learning—the granule-cell receptive fields with respect to sensory and with respect to cortical inputs are highly correlated. This enables cortical cells that respond to a learned odor to enact disynaptic inhibitory control specifically of bulbar principal cells that respond to that odor. For this the reciprocal nature of the granule cell synapses with the principal cells is essential. Functionally, the model predicts context-enhanced stimulus discrimination in cluttered environments (‘olfactory cocktail parties’) and the ability of the system to adapt to its tasks by rapidly switching between different odor-processing modes. These predictions are experimentally testable. At the same time they provide guidance for future experiments aimed at unraveling the cortico-bulbar connectivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zr8mG2szw1g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Differential mobility and local variation in infection attack rate</title>

Infectious disease transmission in animals is an inherently spatial process in which a host’s home location and their social mixing patterns are important, with the mixing of infectious individuals often different to that of susceptible individuals. Although incidence data for humans have traditionally been aggregated into low-resolution data sets, modern representative surveillance systems such as electronic hospital records generate high volume case data with precise home locations. Here, we use a gridded spatial transmission model of arbitrary resolution to investigate the theoretical relationship between population density, differential population movement and local variability in incidence. We show analytically that a uniform local attack rate is only possible for individual pixels in the grid if susceptible and infectious individuals move in the same way. Using a population in Guangdong, China, for which a robust quantitative description of movement is available (a movement kernel), and a natural history consistent with pandemic influenza; we show that local cumulative incidence is positively correlated with population density when susceptible individuals are more connected in space than infectious individuals. Conversely, under the less intuitively likely scenario, when infectious individuals are more connected, local cumulative incidence is negatively correlated with population density. The strength and direction of correlation changes sign for other kernel parameter values. We show that simulation models in which it is assumed implicitly that only infectious individuals move are assuming a slightly unusual specific correlation between population density and attack rate. However, we also show that this potential structural bias can be corrected by using the appropriate non-isotropic kernel that maps infectious-only code onto the isotropic dual-mobility kernel. These results describe a precise relationship between the spatio-social mixing of infectious and susceptible individuals and local variability in attack rates. More generally, these results suggest a genuine risk that mechanistic models of high-resolution attack rate data may reach spurious conclusions if the precise implications of spatial force-of-infection assumptions are not first fully characterized, prior to models being fit to data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bSUhdjfqBC8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Human verbal memory encoding is hierarchically distributed in a continuous processing stream: Human processing stream for verbal memory encoding</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Processing of memory is supported by coordinated activity in a network of sensory, association, and motor brain regions. It remains a major challenge to determine where memory is encoded for later retrieval. Here we used direct intracranial brain recordings from epilepsy patients performing free recall tasks to determine the temporal pattern and anatomical distribution of verbal memory encoding across the entire human cortex. High gamma frequency activity (65-115 Hz) showed consistent power responses during encoding of subsequently recalled and forgotten words on a subset of electrodes localized in 16 distinct cortical areas activated in the tasks. More of the high gamma power during word encoding, and less power before and after the word presentation, was characteristic of successful recall and observed across multiple brain regions. Latencies of the induced power changes and this subsequent memory effect between the recalled and forgotten words followed an anatomical sequence from visual to prefrontal cortical areas. Finally, the magnitude of the memory effect was unexpectedly found to be the largest in selected brain regions both at the top and at the bottom of the processing stream. These included the language processing areas of the prefrontal cortex and the downstream visual areas at the junction of the occipital and temporal lobes. Our results provide evidence for distributed encoding of verbal memory organized along a hierarchical posterior-to-anterior processing stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Verbal memory is a complex function supported by a network of brain regions specialized for perception, decision-making, and execution of action. Our results shed light on the temporal and anatomical organization of this network during encoding of memories for subsequent recall. By finding consistent differences in fast gamma activity recorded directly from the human brain during presentation of words that were later recalled or forgotten, we identified specific regions with the greatest memory effect. This subsequent memory effect was present across a feed-forward processing stream, providing evidence for hierarchical and distributed organization of verbal memory. The identified brain regions in the processing stream present new targets for brain modulation technologies to treat verbal and cognitive deficits in brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Ion Channels and Receptors as Determinants of Microglial Function</title>

	<description>Microglia provide immune surveillance of the CNS. They display diverse behaviors, including nondirectional and directed motility of their processes, phagocytosis of targets such as dying neurons or superfluous synapses, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines. Many of these functions are mediated by ion channels and cell surface receptors, the expression of which varies with the many morphological and functional states that microglial cells can adopt. Recent progress in understanding microglial function has been facilitated by applying classical cell physiological techniques in situ, such as patch-clamping and live imaging, and cell-specific transcriptomic analyses.</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Transgenerational transmission of enhanced ocular dominance plasticity from enriched mice to their non-enriched offspring</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0252-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In recent years, evidence has accumulated that non-Mendelian transgenerational inheritance of qualities acquired through experience is possible. In particular, it has been shown that raising rodents in a so-called enriched environment (EE) can not only modify the animals’ behaviour and increase their susceptibility to activity-dependent neuronal network changes, but also influences both behaviour and neuronal plasticity of the non-enriched offspring. Here, we tested whether such a transgenerational transmission can also be observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) using ocular dominance (OD) plasticity after monocular deprivation (MD) as a paradigm. While OD-plasticity after 7 days of MD is absent in standard-cage (SC) raised mice beyond postnatal day (P) 110, it is present lifelong in EE-raised mice. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging to visualize cortical activity, we confirm these previous observations and additionally show that OD-plasticity is not only preserved in adult EE-mice but also in their adult non-enriched offspring: mice born to enriched parents, but raised in SCs at least until P110 displayed similar OD-shifts towards the open eye after 7 days of MD as age-matched EE-raised animals. Furthermore, testing the offspring of EE-female versus EE-males with SC-mating partners revealed that only pups of EE-females, but not of EE-males, preserved OD-plasticity into adulthood, suggesting that the life experiences of the mother have a greater impact on the continued V1-plasticity of the offspring. The OD-plasticity of the non-enriched pups of EE-mothers was, however, mechanistically different from that of non-enriched pups of EE-parents or EE-mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Recently evidence is accumulating that life experiences and thus acquired qualities of parents can be transmitted across generations in a non-Mendelian fashion and have a significant impact on the fitness of offspring. Raising mice in a so-called enriched environment with enhanced opportunities for social interaction, voluntary physical exercise and explorative behaviour has been shown to boost cortical plasticity. Our results now show that the plasticity-promoting effect of enrichment on ocular dominance plasticity, a well-established plasticity paradigm in a primary sensory cortex, can also be transmitted from enriched parents to their non-enriched offspring. Thus cortical plasticity is not only influenced by an animal’s life experiences but can also be modified by the life experiences of its parents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Reduced White Matter Fiber Density in Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy348</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy348/5298366?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Differences in brain networks and underlying white matter abnormalities have been suggested to underlie symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, robustly characterizing microstructural white matter differences has been challenging. In the present study, we applied an analytic technique that calculates structural metrics specific to differently-oriented fiber bundles within a voxel, termed “fixels”. Fixel-based analyses were used to compare diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data from 25 individuals with ASD (mean age = 16.8 years) and 27 typically developing age-matched controls (mean age = 16.9 years). Group comparisons of fiber density (FD) and bundle morphology were run on a fixel-wise, tract-wise, and global white matter (GWM) basis. We found that individuals with ASD had reduced FD, suggestive of decreased axonal count, in several major white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum (CC), bilateral inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, right arcuate fasciculus, and right uncinate fasciculus, as well as a GWM reduction. Secondary analyses assessed associations with social impairment in participants with ASD, and showed that lower FD in the splenium of the CC was associated with greater social impairment. Our findings suggest that reduced FD could be the primary microstructural white matter abnormality in ASD.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Optic nerve (ON) injury is an established model of axonal injury which results in retrograde degeneration and death of retinal ganglion cells as well anterograde loss of transmission and Wallerian degeneration of the injured axons. While the local impact of ON crush has been extensively documented we know comparatively little about the functional changes that occur in higher visual structures such as primary visual cortex (V1). We explored the extent of adult cortical plasticity using ON crush in aged mice. V1 function of the contralateral hemisphere was assessed longitudinally by intrinsic signal imaging and 2-photon calcium imaging before and after ON crush. Functional imaging demonstrated an immediate shift in V1 ocular dominance towards the ipsilateral, intact eye, due to the expected almost complete loss of responses to contralateral eye stimulation. Surprisingly, within 2 weeks we observed a delayed increase in ipsilateral eye responses. Additionally, spontaneous activity in V1 was reduced, similar to the lesion projection zone after retinal lesions. The observed changes in V1 activity indicate that severe ON injury in adulthood evokes cortical plasticity not only cross-modally but also within the visual cortex; this plasticity may be best compared with that seen after retinal lesions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Selective Modulation of Early Visual Cortical Activity by Movement Intention</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The primate visual system contains myriad feedback projections from higher- to lower-order cortical areas, an architecture that has been implicated in the top-down modulation of early visual areas during working memory and attention. Here we tested the hypothesis that these feedback projections also modulate early visual cortical activity during the planning of visually guided actions. We show, across three separate human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies involving object-directed movements, that information related to the motor effector to be used (i.e., limb, eye) and action goal to be performed (i.e., grasp, reach) can be selectively decoded—prior to movement—from the retinotopic representation of the target object(s) in early visual cortex. We also find that during the planning of sequential actions involving objects in two different spatial locations, that motor-related information can be decoded from both locations in retinotopic cortex. Together, these findings indicate that movement planning selectively modulates early visual cortical activity patterns in an effector-specific, target-centric, and task-dependent manner. These findings offer a neural account of how motor-relevant target features are enhanced during action planning and suggest a possible role for early visual cortex in instituting a sensorimotor estimate of the visual consequences of movement.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sequence Variation Associated with SLC12A5 Gene Expression Is Linked to Brain Structure and Function in Healthy Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt;) gene, rs3918242, has been shown to affect &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt; expression in macrophages and was associated with schizophrenia by two independent groups. However, rs3918242's effects on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt; expression were not replicable in cell lines or brain tissue. Additionally, publically available data indicate that rs3918242 genotype is related not to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt; expression, but rather to expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SLC12A5&lt;/span&gt;, a nearby gene coding for a K+/Cl- cotransporter, whose expression has also been related to schizophrenia. Here, we studied brain structure and function in healthy participants stratified by rs3918242 genotype using structural MRI (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 298), functional MRI during an N-back working memory task (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 554), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during the same task (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 190). We found rs3918242 was associated with gray matter volume (GMV) in the insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally, closely replicated in discovery and replication samples; and with inferior parietal lobule (IPL) GMV when the samples were meta-analytically combined. Additionally, using both fMRI and MEG, rs3918242 was associated with right IPL working memory-related activation, replicated in two cohorts and across imaging modalities. These convergent results provide further impetus for examinations of the relationship of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SLC12A5&lt;/span&gt; with brain structure and function in neuropsychiatric disease.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Biological Characteristics of Connection-Wise Resting-State Functional Connectivity Strength</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy342</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy342/5298363?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Functional connectivity is defined as the statistical dependency of neurophysiological activity between 2 separate brain areas. To investigate the biological characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC)—and in particular the significance of connection-wise variation in time-series correlations—rsFC was compared with strychnine-based connectivity measured in the macaque. Strychnine neuronography is a historical technique that induces activity in cortical areas through means of local administration of the substance strychnine. Strychnine causes local disinhibition through GABA suppression and leads to subsequent activation of functional pathways. Multiple resting-state fMRI recordings were acquired in 4 macaques (examining in total 299 imaging runs) from which a group-averaged rsFC matrix was constructed. rsFC was observed to be higher (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) between region-pairs with a strychnine-based connection as compared with region-pairs with no strychnine-based connection present. In particular, higher resting-state connectivity was observed in connections that were relatively stronger (weak &amp;lt; moderate &amp;lt; strong; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and in connections that were bidirectional (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) instead of unidirectional in strychnine-based connectivity. Our results imply that the level of correlation between brain areas as extracted from resting-state fMRI relates to the strength of underlying interregional functional pathways.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Spontaneous Brain Activity Predicts Task-Evoked Activity During Animate Versus Inanimate Touch</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy340</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy340/5298359?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The spontaneous activity of the brain is characterized by an elaborate temporal structure with scale-free properties as indexed by the power law exponent (PLE). We test the hypothesis that spontaneous brain activity modulates task-evoked activity during interactions with animate versus inanimate stimuli. For this purpose, we developed a paradigm requiring participants to actively touch either animate (real hand) or inanimate (mannequin hand) stimuli. Behaviorally, participants perceived the animate target as closer in space, temporally more synchronous with their own self, and more personally relevant, compared with the inanimate. Neuronally, we observed a modulation of task-evoked activity by animate versus inanimate interactions in posterior insula, in medial prefrontal cortex, comprising anterior cingulate cortex, and in medial superior frontal gyrus. Among these regions, an increased functional connectivity was shown between posterior insula and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC) during animate compared with inanimate interactions and during resting state. Importantly, PLE during spontaneous brain activity in PACC correlated positively with PACC task-evoked activity during animate versus inanimate stimuli. In conclusion, we demonstrate that brain spontaneous activity in PACC can be related to the distinction between animate and inanimate stimuli and thus might be specifically tuned to align our brain with its animate environment.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Coding of Contact Events in Somatosensory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy337</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy337/5298364?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Manual interactions with objects require precise and rapid feedback about contact events. These tactile signals are integrated with motor plans throughout the neuraxis to achieve dexterous object manipulation. To better understand the role of somatosensory cortex in interactions with objects, we measured, using chronically implanted arrays of electrodes, the responses of populations of somatosensory neurons to skin indentations designed to simulate the initiation, maintenance, and termination of contact with an object. First, we find that the responses of somatosensory neurons to contact onset and offset dwarf their responses to maintenance of contact. Second, we show that these responses rapidly and reliably encode features of the simulated contact events—their timing, location, and strength—and can account for the animals’ performance in an amplitude discrimination task. Third, we demonstrate that the spatiotemporal dynamics of the population response in cortex mirror those of the population response in the nerves. We conclude that the responses of populations of somatosensory neurons are well suited to encode contact transients and are consistent with a role of somatosensory cortex in signaling transitions between task subgoals.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Thalamocortical Afferents Innervate the Cortical Subplate much Earlier in Development in Primate than in Rodent</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy327</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy327/5298367?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The current model, based on rodent data, proposes that thalamocortical afferents (TCA) innervate the subplate towards the end of cortical neurogenesis. This implies that the laminar identity of cortical neurons is specified by intrinsic instructions rather than information of thalamic origin. In order to determine whether this mechanism is conserved in the primates, we examined the growth of thalamocortical (TCA) and corticofugal afferents in early human and monkey fetal development. In the human, TCA, identified by secretagogin, calbindin, and ROBO1 immunoreactivity, were observed in the internal capsule of the ventral telencephalon as early as 7–7.5 PCW, crossing the pallial/subpallial boundary (PSB) by 8 PCW before the calretinin immunoreactive corticofugal fibers do. Furthermore, TCA were observed to be passing through the intermediate zone and innervating the presubplate of the dorsolateral cortex, and already by 10–12 PCW TCAs were occupying much of the cortex. Observations at equivalent stages in the marmoset confirmed that this pattern is conserved across primates. Therefore, our results demonstrate that in primates, TCAs innervate the cortical presubplate at earlier stages than previously demonstrated by acetylcholinesterase histochemistry, suggesting that pioneer thalamic afferents may contribute to early cortical circuitry that can participate in defining cortical neuron phenotypes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>In nonlinear systems, converging oscillatory inputs undergo frequency mixing, resulting in additional oscillations in the system’s response. Neural recordings exhibit spectral properties predicted by this process suggesting that not all oscillations originate from synaptic inputs rhythmically active at corresponding frequencies.</description>

Genetic mutant analysis in the nematode &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; has revealed common molecular programs that control neuronal identity. Neuron type-specific combinations of transcription factors, called terminal selectors, act as master regulatory factors to initiate and maintain terminal identity programs through direct regulation of neuron type-specific effector genes. We will provide here an update on recent studies that solidify the terminal selector concept in worms, flies and chordates. We will also describe how the terminal selector concept has been expanded by recent work in &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; to explain neuronal subtype diversification and plasticity of neuronal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

In the field of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) systems have proved their utility and potential for assessing sperm quality, improving the prediction of the fertility potential of a seminal dose. Although most laboratories and scientific centers use commercial systems, in the recent years certain free and open-source alternatives have emerged that can reduce the costs that research groups have to face. However, these open-source alternatives cannot analyze sperm kinetic responses to different stimuli, such as chemotaxis, thermotaxis or rheotaxis. In addition, the programs released to date have not usually been designed to encourage the scalability and the continuity of software development. We have developed an open-source CASA software, called OpenCASA, which allows users to study three classical sperm quality parameters: motility, morphodmetry and membrane integrity (viability) and offers the possibility of analyzing the guided movement response of spermatozoa to different stimuli (useful for chemotaxis, thermotaxis or rheotaxis studies) or different motile cells such as bacteria, using a single software. This software has been released in a Version Control System at Github. This platform will allow researchers not only to download the software but also to be involved in and contribute to further developments. Additionally, a Google group has been created to allow the research community to interact and discuss OpenCASA. For validation of the OpenCASA software, we analysed different simulated sperm populations (for chemotaxis module) and evaluated 36 ejaculates obtained from 12 fertile rams using other sperm analysis systems (for motility, membrane integrity and morphology modules). The results were compared with those obtained by Open-CASA using the Pearson’s correlation and Bland-Altman tests, obtaining a high level of correlation in all parameters and a good agreement between the different used methods and the OpenCASA. With this work, we propose an open-source project oriented to the development of a new software application for sperm quality analysis. This proposed software will use a minimally centralized infrastructure to allow the continued development of its modules by the research community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/26i5OktndI4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Manifold Regularized Multi-Task Learning Model for IQ Prediction from Multiple fMRI Paradigms. (arXiv:1901.05913v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05913</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-modal brain functional connectivity (FC) data have shown great
potential for providing insights into individual variations in behavioral and
cognitive traits. The joint learning of multi-modal imaging data can utilize
the intrinsic association, and thus can boost the learning performance.
Although several multi-task based learning models have already been proposed by
viewing the feature learning on each modality as one task, most of them ignore
the geometric structure information inherent in the modalities, which may play
an important role in extracting discriminative features. In this paper, we
propose a new manifold regularized multi-task learning model by simultaneously
considering between-subject and between-modality relationships. Besides
employing a group-sparsity regularizer to jointly select a few common features
across multiple tasks (modalities), we design a novel manifold regularizer to
preserve the structure information both within and between modalities in our
model. This will make our model more adaptive for realistic data analysis. Our
model is then validated on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort dataset,
where we regard our modalities as functional MRI (fMRI) data collected under
two paradigms. Specifically, we conduct experimental studies on fMRI based FC
network data in two task conditions for intelligence quotient (IQ) prediction.
The results demonstrate that our proposed model can not only achieve improved
prediction performance, but also yield a set of IQ-relevant biomarkers.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Early Salient Region Selection Does Not Drive Rapid Visual Categorization. (arXiv:1901.04908v1 [cs.CV] CROSS LISTED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The current dominant visual processing paradigm in both human and machine
research is the feedforward, layered hierarchy of neural-like processing
elements. Within this paradigm, visual saliency is seen by many to have a
specific role, namely that of early selection. Early selection is thought to
enable very fast visual performance by limiting processing to only the most
relevant candidate portions of an image. Though this strategy has indeed led to
improved processing time efficiency in machine algorithms, at least one set of
critical tests of this idea has never been performed with respect to the role
of early selection in human vision. How would the best of the current saliency
models perform on the stimuli used by experimentalists who first provided
evidence for this visual processing paradigm? Would the algorithms really
provide correct candidate sub-images to enable fast categorization on those
same images? Here, we report on a new series of tests of these questions whose
results suggest that it is quite unlikely that such an early selection process
has any role in human rapid visual categorization.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Thermodynamic model of gene regulation for the Or59b olfactory receptor in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;</title>

Complex eukaryotic promoters normally contain multiple cis-regulatory sequences for different transcription factors (TFs). The binding patterns of the TFs to these sites, as well as the way the TFs interact with each other and with the RNA polymerase (RNAp), lead to combinatorial problems rarely understood in detail, especially under varying epigenetic conditions. The aim of this paper is to build a model describing how the main regulatory cluster of the olfactory receptor Or59b drives transcription of this gene in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The cluster-driven expression of this gene is represented as the equilibrium probability of RNAp being bound to the promoter region, using a statistical thermodynamic approach. The RNAp equilibrium probability is computed in terms of the occupancy probabilities of the single TFs of the cluster to the corresponding binding sites, and of the interaction rules among TFs and RNAp, using experimental data of Or59b expression to tune the model parameters. The model reproduces correctly the changes in RNAp binding probability induced by various mutation of specific sites and epigenetic modifications. Some of its predictions have also been validated in novel experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OzMB2Hh3nOo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) typically contain multiple autophosphorylation sites in their cytoplasmic domains. Once activated, these autophosphorylation sites can recruit downstream signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, which recognize phosphotyrosine-containing short linear motifs (SLiMs). These domains and SLiMs have polyspecific or promiscuous binding activities. Thus, multiple signaling proteins may compete for binding to a common SLiM and vice versa. To investigate the effects of competition on RTK signaling, we used a rule-based modeling approach to develop and analyze models for ligand-induced recruitment of SH2/PTB domain-containing proteins to autophosphorylation sites in the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor (IGF1R). Models were parameterized using published datasets reporting protein copy numbers and site-specific binding affinities. Simulations were facilitated by a novel application of model restructuration, to reduce redundancy in rule-derived equations. We compare predictions obtained via numerical simulation of the model to those obtained through simple prediction methods, such as through an analytical approximation, or ranking by copy number and/or K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; value, and find that the simple methods are unable to recapitulate the predictions of numerical simulations. We created 45 cell line-specific models that demonstrate how early events in IGF1R signaling depend on the protein abundance profile of a cell. Simulations, facilitated by model restructuration, identified pairs of IGF1R binding partners that are recruited in anti-correlated and correlated fashions, despite no inclusion of cooperativity in our models. This work shows that the outcome of competition depends on the physicochemical parameters that characterize pairwise interactions, as well as network properties, including network connectivity and the relative abundances of competitors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FF8MbA9TfH8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Some mammalian lineages, such as primates, exhibit exceptionally large cortices relative to the amount of sensory inputs from the dorsal thalamus, and this expansion is associated with a larger number of distinct cortical areas, composing a larger proportion of the cortical sheet. We propose a link between the organization of the neocortex and its expansion relative to the size of the dorsal thalamus, based on a combination of work in comparative neuroanatomy and experimental research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;{\it Ellsberg thought experiments} and empirical confirmation of Ellsberg
preferences pose serious challenges to {\it subjective expected utility theory}
(SEUT). We have recently elaborated a quantum-theoretic framework for human
decisions under uncertainty which satisfactorily copes with the Ellsberg
paradox and other puzzles of SEUT. We apply here the quantum-theoretic
framework to the {\it Ellsberg two-urn example}, showing that the paradox can
be explained by assuming a state change of the conceptual entity that is the
object of the decision ({\it decision-making}, or {\it DM}, {\it entity}) and
representing subjective probabilities by quantum probabilities. We also model
the empirical data we collected in a DM test on human participants within the
theoretic framework above. The obtained results are relevant, as they provide a
line to model real life, e.g., financial and medical, decisions that show the
same empirical patterns as the two-urn experiment.

	<description>In the inner ear, the deflection of hair bundles, the sensory organelles of hair cells, activates mechanically-gated channels (MGCs). Hair bundles monitor orientation of the head, its angular and linear acceleration, and detect sound. Force applied to MGCs is shaped by intrinsic hair-bundle properties, by the mechanical load on the bundle, and by the filter imparted by the environment of the hair bundle. Channel gating and adaptation, the ability of the bundle to reset its operating point, contribute to hair-bundle mechanics.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Proposed Mechanism for Spontaneous Transitions between Interictal and Ictal Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/557?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/557?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epileptic networks are characterized by two outputs: brief interictal spikes and rarer, more prolonged seizures. Although either output state is readily modeled &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and induced experimentally, the transition mechanisms are unknown, in part because no models exhibit both output states spontaneously. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; small-world neural networks were built using single-compartment neurons whose physiological parameters were derived from dual whole-cell recordings of pyramidal cells in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures that were generating spontaneous seizure-like activity. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt;, neurons were connected by abundant local synapses and rare long-distance synapses. Activity-dependent synaptic depression and gradual recovery delimited synchronous activity. Full synaptic recovery engendered interictal population spikes that spread via long-distance synapses. When synaptic recovery was incomplete, postsynaptic neurons required coincident activation of multiple presynaptic terminals to reach firing threshold. Only local connections were sufficiently dense to spread activity under these conditions. This coalesced network activity into traveling waves whose velocity varied with synaptic recovery. Seizures were comprised of sustained traveling waves that were similar to those recorded during experimental and human neocortical seizures. Sustained traveling waves occurred only when wave velocity, network dimensions, and the rate of synaptic recovery enabled wave reentry into previously depressed areas at precisely ictogenic levels of synaptic recovery. Wide-field, cellular-resolution GCamP7b calcium imaging demonstrated similar initial patterns of activation in the hippocampus, although the anatomical distribution of traveling waves of synaptic activation was altered by the pattern of synaptic connectivity in the organotypic hippocampal cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When computerized distributed neural network models are required to generate both features of epileptic networks (i.e., spontaneous interictal population spikes and seizures), the network structure is substantially constrained. These constraints provide important new hypotheses regarding the nature of epileptic networks and mechanisms of seizure onset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Tau Accumulation in Clinically Normal Older Adults Is Associated with Hippocampal Hyperactivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/548?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/548?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animal studies demonstrate that hyperactive neurons facilitate early accumulation and spread of tau and amyloid-β proteins in the pathological cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human neuroimaging studies have linked hippocampal hyperactivity to amyloid-β accumulation, apolipoprotein 4 (APOE4) and clinical progression from prodromal AD to clinical dementia. The relationship between hippocampal hyperactivity and early AD molecular pathology (amyloid-β and tau accumulation) before clinical symptoms remains to be elucidated. Here, we studied 120 clinically normal older humans (80 females/40 males) enrolled in the Harvard Aging Brain Study. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity during successful memory encoding and amyloid-β accumulation with PiB-positron emission tomography imaging. Additionally, we measured tau accumulation using AV1451 PET imaging in a subset of 87 participants. In this subset, we found that inferior temporal tau accumulation was associated with increased fMRI activity in the hippocampus, but showed no clear association with amyloid. Together, the findings support a hypothetical model of the evolution of preclinical AD that place hippocampal hyperactivity concurrent with spread of tau pathology to neocortical regions before clinical impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The circumstances under which the hippocampus becomes hyperactive in preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have thus far remained elusive. Recent advances in positron emission tomography (PET) tracers now enable &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; characterization of amyloid-β and tau accumulation. Here, we combine amyloid and tau PET with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the association between Alzheimer's disease pathology and memory-related brain activity in clinically normal older adults. We found an association between increased hippocampal activity and tau accumulation in the inferior temporal cortex. These data suggest that the pathogenesis of hippocampal hyperactivity occurs concurrent with the spread of tau pathology from the entorhinal cortex to the neocortex, before the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dopamine D2/3 Binding Potential Modulates Neural Signatures of Working Memory in a Load-Dependent Fashion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/537?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/537?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine (DA) modulates corticostriatal connections. Studies in which imaging of the DA system is integrated with functional imaging during cognitive performance have yielded mixed findings. Some work has shown a link between striatal DA (measured by PET) and fMRI activations, whereas others have failed to observe such a relationship. One possible reason for these discrepant findings is differences in task demands, such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations may yield a stronger association with DA. Moreover, a potential DA–BOLD association may be modulated by task performance. We studied 155 (104 normal-performing and 51 low-performing) healthy older adults (43% females) who underwent fMRI scanning while performing a working memory (WM) &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-back task along with DA D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; PET assessment using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride. Using multivariate partial-least-squares analysis, we observed a significant pattern revealing positive associations of striatal as well as extrastriatal DA D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors to BOLD response in the thalamo–striatal–cortical circuit, which supports WM functioning. Critically, the DA–BOLD association in normal-performing, but not low-performing, individuals was expressed in a load-dependent fashion, with stronger associations during 3-back than 1-/2-back conditions. Moreover, normal-performing adults expressing upregulated BOLD in response to increasing task demands showed a stronger DA–BOLD association during 3-back, whereas low-performing individuals expressed a stronger association during 2-back conditions. This pattern suggests a nonlinear DA–BOLD performance association, with the strongest link at the maximum capacity level. Together, our results suggest that DA may have a stronger impact on functional brain responses during more demanding cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine (DA) is a major neuromodulator in the CNS and plays a key role in several cognitive processes via modulating the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Some studies have shown a link between DA and BOLD, whereas others have failed to observe such a relationship. A possible reason for the discrepancy is differences in task demands, such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations may yield a stronger association with DA. We examined the relationship of DA to BOLD response during working memory under three load conditions and found that the DA–BOLD association is expressed in a load-dependent fashion. These findings may help explain the disproportionate impairment evident in more effortful cognitive tasks in normal aging and in those suffering dopamine-dependent neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sexually dimorphic vasopressin cells modulate social investigation and communication in sex-specific ways</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The neuropeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) has long been implicated in the regulation of social behavior and communication, but precisely which AVP cell groups are involved is largely unknown. To address if the sexually dimorphic AVP cell group in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for social communication, we deleted BNST AVP cells by viral delivery of a Cre-dependent caspase-3 cell-death construct in AVP-iCre positive mice using AVP-iCre negative littermate as controls, and assessed social, sexual, aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. In males, lesioning BNST AVP cells reduced social investigation of other males and increased urine marking in the presence of a live female, without altering ultrasonic vocalizations, resident-intruder aggression, copulatory behavior, anxiety, or investigation of females or their odor cues. In females, which have significantly fewer AVP cells in the BNST, these injections influenced copulatory behavior but otherwise had minimal effects on social behavior and communication, indicating that these cells contribute to sex differences in social behavioral function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Despite over thirty years of indirect evidence implicating sexually-dimorphic arginine vasopressin (AVP) cells within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the control of social and anxiety-related behavior in mammals, the function of these cells has never been directly tested. Here, we show that deletion of these cells in male, but not female, mice reduce investigation of same-sex conspecifics and alter social communication without changing aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. Although AVP cell deletion in the BNST did not alter male copulatory behavior, it impaired female sexual behavior. These results indicate that sexually-dimorphic AVP cells in the BNST drive specific aspects of sexually-differentiated social investigation, behavior, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: June 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Fabian Rentzsch, Celina Juliano, Brigitte Galliot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cnidarians shared a common ancestor with bilaterians more than 600 million years ago. This sister group relationship gives them an informative phylogenetic position for understanding the fascinating morphological and molecular cell type diversity of bilaterian nervous systems. Moreover, cnidarians display novel features such as endodermal neurogenesis and independently evolved centralizations, which provide a platform for understanding the evolution of nervous system innovations. In recent years, the application of modern genomic tools has significantly advanced our understanding of cnidarian nervous system structure and function. For example, transgenic reporter lines and gene knockdown experiments in several cnidarian species reveal a significant degree of conservation in the neurogenesis gene regulatory program, while single cell RNA sequencing projects are providing a much deeper understanding of cnidarian neural cell type diversity. At the level of neural function, the physiological properties of ion channels have been described and calcium imaging of the nervous system in whole animals has allowed for the identification of neural circuits underlying specific behaviours. Cnidarians have arrived in the modern era of molecular neurobiology and are primed to provide exciting new insights into the early evolution of nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The control of release probability at nerve terminals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The control of release probability at nerve terminals, Published online: 15 January 2019; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-018-0111-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41583-018-0111-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Neurosecretion is controlled by SNAREs and SNARE-binding proteins and is initiated by the influx of Ca2+ ions through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). In this Review, Dittman and Ryan discuss progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of VGCCs and fusion machinery.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/rJ1dQkQY05I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time is just a memory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is just a memory, Published online: 14 January 2019; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0331-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0331-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Experience unfolds continuously in time, but we remember discrete sequences of events. In this issue of Nature Neuroscience, Montchal et al. describe brain activity patterns that predict how well people remember precisely when recent events occurred. Converging evidence suggests that homologous neural machinery structures temporal representations in rats and people.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/dJNHQT28zPU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: June 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Megan Crow, Jesse Gillis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent technical advances have enabled transcriptomics experiments at an unprecedented scale, and single-cell profiles from neural tissue are accumulating rapidly. There has been considerable effort to use these profiles to understand cell diversity, primarily through unsupervised clustering and differential expression analysis. However, current practices to validate these findings vary. In this review, we describe recent efforts to evaluate clusters from single-cell RNA-sequencing data, and provide a framework for considering current evidence and practices in terms of their capacity to establish principles of cell biology. Single-cell RNA-sequencing has already transformed neuroscience. By facilitating detailed comparative and genetic perturbation analyses, it may provide the tools to uncover fundamental mechanisms of neural diversity throughout the tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
