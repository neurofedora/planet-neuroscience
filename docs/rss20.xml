The folding of proteins with a complex knot is still an unresolved question. Based on representative members of Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolases (UCHs) that contain the 5&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knot in the native state, we explain how UCHs are able to unfold and refold &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; reversibly within the structure-based model. In particular, we identify two, topologically different folding/unfolding pathways and corroborate our results with experiment, recreating the chevron plot. We show that confinement effect of chaperonin or weak crowding greatly facilitates folding, simultaneously slowing down the unfolding process of UCHs, compared with bulk conditions. Finally, we analyze the existence of knots in the denaturated state of UCHs. The results of the work show that the crowded environment of the cell should have a positive effect on the kinetics of complex knotted proteins, especially when proteins with deeper knots are found in this family.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IQnzANgGzpM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dopaminergic Drug Effects on Probability Weighting during Risky Decision-Making</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Dopamine has been associated with risky decision-making, as well as with pathological gambling, a behavioural addiction characterized by excessive risk-taking behaviour. However, the specific mechanisms through which dopamine might act to foster risk-taking and pathological gambling remain elusive. Here we test the hypothesis that this might be achieved, in part, via modulation of subjective probability weighting during decision-making. Human healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21) and pathological gamblers (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) played a decision-making task involving choices between sure monetary options and risky gambles both in the gain and loss domains. Each participant played the task twice, either under placebo or the dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist sulpiride, in a double-blind counter-balanced design. A prospect theory modelling approach was used to estimate subjective probability weighting and sensitivity to monetary outcomes. Consistent with prospect theory, we found that participants presented a distortion in the subjective weighting of probabilities, i.e. they overweighted low probabilities and underweighted moderate to high probabilities, both in the gain and loss domains. Compared with placebo, sulpiride attenuated this distortion in the gain domain. Across drugs, the groups did not differ in their probability weighting, although gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities in the placebo condition. Overall, our results reveal that dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonism modulates the subjective weighting of probabilities in the gain domain, in the direction of more objective, economically rational decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine has been implicated in risky decision-making and gambling addiction, but the exact mechanisms underlying this influence remain partly elusive. Here we tested the hypothesis that dopamine modulates subjective probability weighting, by examining the effect of a dopaminergic drug on risk-taking behavior, both in healthy individuals and pathologic gamblers. We found that selectively blocking dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors diminished the typically observed distortion of winning probabilities, characterized by an overweighting of low probabilities and underweighting of high probabilities. This made participants more linear in their subjective estimation of probabilities and thus more rational in their decision-making behavior. Healthy participants and pathologic gamblers did not differ in their risk-taking behavior, except in the placebo condition in which gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Excitatory Neuronal Responses of Ca2+ Transients in Interstitial Cells of Cajal in the Small Intestine</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) regulate smooth muscle excitability and motility in the gastrointestinal tract. ICC in the deep muscular plexus (ICC-DMP) of the small intestine are aligned closely with varicosities of enteric motor neurons and thought to transduce neural responses. ICC-DMP generate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients that activate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activated Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; channels and generate electrophysiological responses. We tested the hypothesis that excitatory neurotransmitters regulate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP as a means of regulating intestinal muscles. High-resolution confocal microscopy was used to image Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP within murine small intestinal muscles with cell-specific expression of GCaMP3. Intrinsic nerves were stimulated by electrical field stimulation (EFS). ICC-DMP exhibited ongoing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients before stimuli were applied. EFS caused initial suppression of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, followed by escape during sustained stimulation, and large increases in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients after cessation of stimulation. Basal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity and the excitatory phases of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses to EFS were inhibited by atropine and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1) antagonists, but not by NK2 receptor antagonists. Exogenous ACh and substance P increased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, atropine and NK1 antagonists decreased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. Neurokinins appear to be released spontaneously (tonic excitation) in small intestinal muscles and are the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters. Subcellular regulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release events in ICC-DMP may be a means by which excitatory neurotransmission organizes intestinal motility patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are innervated by enteric motor neurons and thought to transduce neural responses in GI muscles. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, due to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; intracellular stores, mediate electrophysiological events in ICC by activation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Neural responses in ICC in the deep muscular plexus of the small intestine (ICC-DMP) were studied by confocal imaging of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in these cells. Excitatory neural input was due to cholinergic and peptidergic neurotransmitters (acetylcholine and neurokinins), as excitatory effects on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients were blocked by atropine and neurokinin receptor antagonists. Neurokinins are the dominant excitatory regulators of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP. ICC-DMP are innervated by enteric motor neurons and mediate significant excitatory responses in intestinal muscles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Studies using anatomical, electrophysiological, imaging and optogenetic approaches revealed that the CEA network consists of recurrent inhibitory circuits comprised of precisely connected functionally and genetically defined cell types that can select and control specific behavioral outputs [3,4,5&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,6&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,7–9,11,12]. While bivalent functionality of the CEA in adaptive behavior has been clearly demonstrated, we are just beginning to understand to which degree individual CEA circuit elements are functionally segregated or overlapping. Importantly, recent studies seem to suggest that optogenetic manipulations of the same, or overlapping cell populations can give rise to distinct, or sometimes even opposite, behavioral phenotypes [5&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,6&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,9–12]. In this review, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of how defined CEA circuits can control defensive and appetitive behaviors, and how seemingly contradictory results could point to an integrated concept of CEA function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: August 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Sylvain   Rama, Mickaël   Zbili, Dominique   Debanne&lt;br /&gt; Axons link distant brain regions and are usually considered as simple transmission cables in which reliable propagation occurs once an action potential has been generated. Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

By probing how activity patterns in different types of neurons and circuits contribute to behavior, these tools can help inform mechanistic models of brain function and explain the roles of distinct circuit elements.

	<description>Publication date: April 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Karel   Svoboda, Nuo   Li&lt;br /&gt; Neurons in motor cortex and connected brain regions fire in anticipation of specific movements, long before movement occurs. This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Despite extensive characterization of individual brain areas involved in parental care, we do not fully understand how discrete aspects of this behavior are orchestrated at the neural circuit level. Recent progress in identifying genetically specified neuronal populations critical for parenting, and the use of genetic and viral tools for circuit-cracking now allow us to deconstruct the underlying circuitry and, thus, to elucidate how different aspects of parental care are controlled. Here we review the latest advances, outline possible organizational principles of parental circuits and discuss future challenges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Pre-clinical investigations implicate modulation of the cortico-basal ganglia network in these therapeutic effects, and this mechanistic understanding is necessary to optimize stimulation paradigms. Recently, the principle that neuromodulation can reverse drug-evoked synaptic plasticity and reduce behavioral symptoms of addiction has inspired novel stimulation paradigms that have long-term effects in animal models. Pre-clinical studies have also raised the possibility that tailoring neuromodulation protocols can modulate distinct symptoms of addiction. Combining mechanistic knowledge of circuit dysfunction with emerging technologies for non-invasive neuromodulation holds promise for developing therapies for addiction and related disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

In this review, we will discuss recent human and rodent studies showing the sex-specific involvement of the neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin in social and anxiety-related behaviors. We discuss that sex differences can be evident at pre-pubertal ages as seen in the sex-specific regulation of social recognition, social play, and anxiety by the vasopressin system in juvenile rats. We further discuss that the oxytocin system in humans and rodents alters brain activation, anxiety, and sociosexual motivation in sex-specific ways. Finally, we propose that knowledge of vasopressin and oxytocin mediated sex-specific brain mechanisms can provide essential insights into how these neuropeptide systems contribute to sex-specific vulnerability as well as resilience to perturbations, with subsequent relevance to social and emotional disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: April 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Paola   Cognigni, Johannes   Felsenberg, Scott   Waddell&lt;br /&gt; When animals learn, plasticity in brain networks that respond to specific cues results in a change in the behavior that these cues elicit. Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini&lt;br /&gt; Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Contrasting information theoretic decompositions of modulatory and arithmetic interactions in neural information processing systems. (arXiv:1803.05897v1 [cs.IT])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05897</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Biological and artificial neural systems are composed of many local
processors, and their capabilities depend upon the transfer function that
relates each local processor's outputs to its inputs. This paper uses a recent
advance in the foundations of information theory to study the properties of
local processors that use contextual input to amplify or attenuate transmission
of information about their driving inputs. This advance enables the information
transmitted by processors with two distinct inputs to be decomposed into those
components unique to each input, that shared between the two inputs, and that
which depends on both though it is in neither, i.e. synergy. The decompositions
that we report here show that contextual modulation has information processing
properties that contrast with those of all four simple arithmetic operators,
that it can take various forms, and that the form used in our previous studies
of artificial neural nets composed of local processors with both driving and
contextual inputs is particularly well-suited to provide the distinctive
capabilities of contextual modulation under a wide range of conditions. We
argue that the decompositions reported here could be compared with those
obtained from empirical neurobiological and psychophysical data under
conditions thought to reflect contextual modulation. That would then shed new
light on the underlying processes involved. Finally, we suggest that such
decompositions could aid the design of context-sensitive machine learning
algorithms.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effective Connectivity from Single Trial fMRI Data by Sampling Biologically Plausible Models. (arXiv:1803.05840v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The estimation of causal network architectures in the brain is fundamental
for understanding cognitive information processes. However, access to the
dynamic processes underlying cognition is limited to indirect measurements of
the hidden neuronal activity, for instance through fMRI data. Thus, estimating
the network structure of the underlying process is challenging. In this
article, we embed an adaptive importance sampler called Adaptive Path Integral
Smoother (APIS) into the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to obtain point
estimates of causal connectivity. We demonstrate on synthetic data that this
procedure finds not only the correct network structure but also the direction
of effective connections from random initializations of the connectivity
matrix. In addition--motivated by contradictory claims in the literature--we
examine the effect of the neuronal timescale on the sensitivity of the BOLD
signal to changes in the connectivity and on the maximum likelihood solutions
of the connectivity. We conclude with two warnings: First, the connectivity
estimates under the assumption of slow dynamics can be extremely biased if the
data was generated by fast neuronal processes. Second, the faster the time
scale, the less sensitive the BOLD signal is to changes in the incoming
connections to a node. Hence, connectivity estimation using realistic neural
dynamics timescale requires extremely high-quality data and seems infeasible in
many practical data sets.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Receptive profiles induce functional architecture of V1. (arXiv:1803.05783v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05783</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work we show how to construct connectivity kernels induced by the
receptive profiles of simple cells of the primary visual cortex (V1). These
kernels are directly defined by the shape of such profiles: this provides a
metric model for the functional architecture of V1, whose global geometry is
determined by the reciprocal interactions between local elements. Our
construction adapts to any bank of filters chosen to represent the set of
receptive profiles of simple cells, since it does not require any structure on
the parameterization on the family. The connectivity kernel that we define
carries a geometrical structure consistent with the well-known properties of
long-range horizontal connections in V1, and it is compatible with the
perceptual rules synthesized by the concept of association field. These
characteristics are still present when the kernel is constructed from a bank of
filters arising from an unsupervised learning algorithm.

	<description>A predominant view of perirhinal cortex (PRC) and postrhinal/parahippocampal cortex (POR/PHC) function contends that these structures are tuned to represent objects and spatial information, respectively. However, known anatomical connectivity, together with recent electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and lesion data, indicate that both brain areas participate in spatial and nonspatial processing. Instead of content-based organization, the PRC and PHC/POR may participate in two computationally distinct cortical–hippocampal networks: one network that is tuned to process coarse information quickly, forming gist-like representations of scenes/environments, and a second network tuned to process information about the specific sensory details that are necessary for discrimination across sensory modalities.</description>

	<description>Cranial motor nuclei in the brainstem innervate diverse types of head and neck muscles. Failure in establishing these neuromuscular connections causes congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDDs) characterized by abnormal craniofacial movements. However, mechanisms that link cranial motor nuclei to target muscles are poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, we report that protocadherin-mediated repulsion mediates neuromuscular connection in the ocular motor system in zebrafish. We identify pools of abducens motor neurons that are topographically arranged according to soma size and convergently innervate a single muscle. Disruptions of Duane retraction syndrome-associated transcription factors reveal that these neurons require Mafba/MAFB, but not Sall4/SALL4, for differentiation. Furthermore, genetic perturbations of Pcdh17/Protocadherin-17 result in defective axon growth and soma clumping, thereby abolishing neuromuscular connectivity. Our results suggest that protocadherin-mediated repulsion forms the central topography and efferent projection pattern of the abducens nucleus following Mafba-dependent specification, and imply potential involvement of protocadherins in CCDD etiology.</description>

	<description>Alcohol abuse is common, imposes a staggering burden on public health, and is challenging to treat, underscoring the need to develop a deeper understanding of the underlying neurobiology. When administered acutely, ethyl alcohol reduces threat reactivity in humans and other animals, and there is growing evidence that threat-dampening and related negative reinforcement mechanisms support the etiology and recurrence of alcohol and other kinds of substance misuse. Converging lines of evidence motivate the hypothesis that these effects are mediated by the central extended amygdala (EAc)--including the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST)--but the relevance of this circuitry to acute alcohol effects in humans remains poorly understood. Using a single-blind, randomized-groups design, multiband imaging data were acquired from 49 social drinkers while they performed an fMRI-optimized emotional-faces/places paradigm after consuming alcohol or placebo. Relative to placebo, alcohol significantly dampened reactivity to threat-related emotional faces in the BST. To rigorously assess potential regional differences in activation, data were extracted from anatomically defined Ce and BST regions-of-interest. Analyses revealed a similar pattern of dampening across the two regions. In short, alcohol acutely dampens reactivity to threat-related faces in humans and it does so similarly across the two major divisions of the EAc. These observations provide a framework for understanding the translational relevance of addiction models derived from work in rodents, inform on-going debates about the functional organization of the EAc, and set the stage for bi-directional translational models aimed at developing improved treatment strategies for alcohol abuse and other addictions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Differential brain mechanisms of selection and maintenance of information during working memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283234v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Working memory is our ability to temporarily hold information as needed for complex cognitive operations. Models of working memory distinguish two separate processes: (i) a selection rule that identifies the content to be recalled and (ii) the maintenance of the content. We aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying these two components. Healthy participants performed a visual working memory task during magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording. Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) and source analyses identified two distinct types of working memory neural processes underlying selection and maintenance of the content. The selection rule is specifically decoded from sustained low-frequency (&amp;lt;20Hz) neural activity within a cortical network that includes the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. By contrast, working memory content is transiently reactivated over a distributed and occipito-temporal network that differs from that encoding the sensory stimulus. These results reveal different neural mechanisms that select and maintain information in memory and could account for previous paradoxical reports of persistent and dynamic neural correlates of working memory.</description>

Understanding the control of epigenetic regulation is key to explain and modify the aging process. Because histone-modifying enzymes are sensitive to shifts in availability of cofactors (e.g. metabolites), cellular epigenetic states may be tied to changing conditions associated with cofactor variability. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationships between cofactor fluctuations, epigenetic landscapes, and cell state transitions. Using Approximate Bayesian Computation, we generate an ensemble of epigenetic regulation (ER) systems whose heterogeneity reflects variability in cofactor pools used by histone modifiers. The heterogeneity of epigenetic metabolites, which operates as regulator of the kinetic parameters promoting/preventing histone modifications, stochastically drives phenotypic variability. The ensemble of ER configurations reveals the occurrence of distinct epi-states within the ensemble. Whereas resilient states maintain large epigenetic barriers refractory to reprogramming cellular identity, plastic states lower these barriers, and increase the sensitivity to reprogramming. Moreover, fine-tuning of cofactor levels redirects plastic epigenetic states to re-enter epigenetic resilience, and vice versa. Our ensemble model agrees with a model of metabolism-responsive loss of epigenetic resilience as a cellular aging mechanism. Our findings support the notion that cellular aging, and its reversal, might result from stochastic translation of metabolic inputs into resilient/plastic cell states via ER systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O1S3sVW-8ko&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Imbalanced amplification: A mechanism of amplification and suppression from local imbalance of excitation and inhibition in cortical circuits</title>

Understanding the relationship between external stimuli and the spiking activity of cortical populations is a central problem in neuroscience. Dense recurrent connectivity in local cortical circuits can lead to counterintuitive response properties, raising the question of whether there are simple arithmetical rules for relating circuits’ connectivity structure to their response properties. One such arithmetic is provided by the mean field theory of balanced networks, which is derived in a limit where excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents precisely balance on average. However, balanced network theory is not applicable to some biologically relevant connectivity structures. We show that cortical circuits with such structure are susceptible to an amplification mechanism arising when excitatory-inhibitory balance is broken at the level of local subpopulations, but maintained at a global level. This amplification, which can be quantified by a linear correction to the classical mean field theory of balanced networks, explains several response properties observed in cortical recordings and provides fundamental insights into the relationship between connectivity structure and neural responses in cortical circuits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FNF84rL9qos&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We present a new educational initiative called Meet-U that aims to train students for collaborative work in computational biology and to bridge the gap between education and research. Meet-U mimics the setup of collaborative research projects and takes advantage of the most popular tools for collaborative work and of cloud computing. Students are grouped in teams of 4–5 people and have to realize a project from A to Z that answers a challenging question in biology. Meet-U promotes &quot;coopetition,&quot; as the students collaborate within and across the teams and are also in competition with each other to develop the best final product. Meet-U fosters interactions between different actors of education and research through the organization of a meeting day, open to everyone, where the students present their work to a jury of researchers and jury members give research seminars. This very unique combination of education and research is strongly motivating for the students and provides a formidable opportunity for a scientific community to unite and increase its visibility. We report on our experience with Meet-U in two French universities with master’s students in bioinformatics and modeling, with protein–protein docking as the subject of the course. Meet-U is easy to implement and can be straightforwardly transferred to other fields and/or universities. All the information and data are available at www.meet-u.org.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uLDwRntm3uo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

It is generally acknowledged that, for reproducibility and progress of human genomic research, data sharing is critical. For every sharing transaction, a successful data exchange is produced between a data consumer and a data provider. Providers of human genomic data (e.g., publicly or privately funded repositories and data archives) fulfil their social contract with data donors when their shareable data conforms to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles. Based on our experiences via Repositive (https://repositive.io), a leading discovery platform cataloguing all shared human genomic datasets, we propose guidelines for data providers wishing to maximise their shared data’s FAIRness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RmCLx4LfFZo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) affects the efficiency of synaptic
transmission for persistent presynaptic activities. We consider attractor
neural networks, for which the attractors are given, in the absence of STSP, by
cell assemblies of excitatory cliques. We show that STSP may transform these
attracting states into attractor relics, inducing ongoing transient-state
dynamics in terms of sequences of transiently activated cell assemblies, the
former attractors. Subsequent cell assemblies may be both disjoint or partially
overlapping. It may hence be possible to use the resulting dynamics for the
generation of motor control sequences.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modern deep learning enabled artificial neural networks, such as Deep Neural
Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), have achieved a series of
breaking records on a broad spectrum of recognition applications. However, the
enormous computation and storage requirements associated with such deep and
complex neural network models greatly challenge their implementations on
resource-limited platforms. Time-based spiking neural network has recently
emerged as a promising solution in Neuromorphic Computing System designs for
achieving remarkable computing and power efficiency within a single chip.
However, the relevant research activities have been narrowly concentrated on
the biological plausibility and theoretical learning approaches, causing
inefficient neural processing and impracticable multilayer extension thus
significantly limitations on speed and accuracy when handling the realistic
cognitive tasks. In this work, a practical multilayer time-based spiking
neuromorphic architecture, namely &quot;MT-Spike&quot;, is developed to fill this gap.
With the proposed practical time-coding scheme, average delay response model,
temporal error backpropagation algorithm, and heuristic loss function,
&quot;MT-Spike&quot; achieves more efficient neural processing through flexible neural
model size reduction while offering very competitive classification accuracy
for realistic recognition tasks. Simulation results well validated that the
algorithmic power of deep multi-layer learning can be seamlessly merged with
the efficiency of time-based spiking neuromorphic architecture, demonstrating
great potentials of &quot;MT-Spike&quot; in resource and power constrained embedded
platforms.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting advancements in AI over the last decade is the wide
adoption of ANNs, such as DNN and CNN, in many real-world applications.
However, the underlying massive amounts of computation and storage requirement
greatly challenge their applicability in resource-limited platforms like the
drone, mobile phone, and IoT devices etc. The third generation of neural
network model--Spiking Neural Network (SNN), inspired by the working mechanism
and efficiency of human brain, has emerged as a promising solution for
achieving more impressive computing and power efficiency within light-weighted
devices (e.g. single chip). However, the relevant research activities have been
narrowly carried out on conventional rate-based spiking system designs for
fulfilling the practical cognitive tasks, underestimating SNN's energy
efficiency, throughput, and system flexibility. Although the time-based SNN can
be more attractive conceptually, its potentials are not unleashed in realistic
applications due to lack of efficient coding and practical learning schemes. In
this work, a Precise-Time-Dependent Single Spike Neuromorphic Architecture,
namely &quot;PT-Spike&quot;, is developed to bridge this gap. Three constituent
hardware-favorable techniques: precise single-spike temporal encoding,
efficient supervised temporal learning, and fast asymmetric decoding are
proposed accordingly to boost the energy efficiency and data processing
capability of the time-based SNN at a more compact neural network model size
when executing real cognitive tasks. Simulation results show that &quot;PT-Spike&quot;
demonstrates significant improvements in network size, processing efficiency
and power consumption with marginal classification accuracy degradation when
compared with the rate-based SNN and ANN under the similar network
configuration.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The study of correlations between brain regions is an important chapter of
the analysis of large-scale brain spatiotemporal dynamics. In particular, novel
methods suited to extract dynamic changes in mutual correlations are needed.
Here we scrutinize a recently reported metric dubbed &quot;Multiplication of
Temporal Derivatives&quot; (MTD) which is based on the temporal derivative of each
time series. The formal comparison of the MTD formula with the Pearson
correlation of a time derivative reveals only minor differences, which we find
negligible in practice. A comparison with the sliding window Pearson
correlation of the raw time series in several stationary and non-stationary
set-ups do not indicate any mathematical advantages of the proposed metric over
commonly used correlation methods. Additionally, the results of our analysis
show that a metric based on derivatives performs worse in a realistic scenario
of stationary network detection.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Closed-loop robots driven by short-term synaptic plasticity: Emergent explorative vs. limit-cycle locomotion. (arXiv:1608.02838v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02838</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02838</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We examine the hypothesis, that short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) may
generate self-organized motor patterns. We simulated sphere-shaped autonomous
robots, within the LPZRobots simulation package, containing three weights
moving along orthogonal internal rods. The position of a weight is controlled
by a single neuron receiving excitatory input from the sensor, measuring its
actual position, and inhibitory inputs from the other two neurons. The
inhibitory connections are transiently plastic, following physiologically
inspired STSP-rules. We find that a wide palette of motion patterns are
generated through the interaction of STSP, robot, and environment (closed-loop
configuration), including various forward meandering and circular motions,
together with chaotic trajectories. The observed locomotion is robust with
respect to additional interactions with obstacles. In the chaotic phase the
robot is seemingly engaged in actively exploring its environment. We believe
that our results constitute a concept of proof that transient synaptic
plasticity, as described by STSP, may potentially be important for the
generation of motor commands and for the emergence of complex locomotion
patterns, adapting seamlessly also to unexpected environmental feedback. We
observe spontaneous and collision induced mode switchings, finding in addition,
that locomotion may follow transiently limit cycles which are otherwise
unstable. Regular locomotion corresponds to stable limit cycles in the
sensorimotor loop, which may be characterized in turn by arbitrary angles of
propagation. This degeneracy is, in our analysis, one of the drivings for the
chaotic wandering observed for selected parameter settings, which is induced by
the smooth diffusion of the angle of propagation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The sensorimotor loop as a dynamical system: How regular motion primitives may emerge from self-organized limit cycles. (arXiv:1511.04338v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04338</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04338</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigate the sensorimotor loop of simple robots simulated within the
LPZRobots environment from the point of view of dynamical systems theory. For a
robot with a cylindrical shaped body and an actuator controlled by a single
proprioceptual neuron we find various types of periodic motions in terms of
stable limit cycles. These are self-organized in the sense, that the dynamics
of the actuator kicks in only, for a certain range of parameters, when the
barrel is already rolling, stopping otherwise. The stability of the resulting
rolling motions terminates generally, as a function of the control parameters,
at points where fold bifurcations of limit cycles occur. We find that several
branches of motion types exist for the same parameters, in terms of the
relative frequencies of the barrel and of the actuator, having each their
respective basins of attractions in terms of initial conditions. For low
drivings stable limit cycles describing periodic and drifting back-and-forth
motions are found additionally. These modes allow to generate symmetry breaking
explorative behavior purely by the timing of an otherwise neutral signal with
respect to the cyclic back-and-forth motion of the robot.

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Humans commonly operate within 3D environments such as multifloor buildings and yet there is a surprising dearth of studies that have examined how these spaces are represented in the brain. Here, we had participants learn the locations of paintings within a virtual multilevel gallery building and then used behavioral tests and fMRI repetition suppression analyses to investigate how this 3D multicompartment space was represented, and whether there was a bias in encoding vertical and horizontal information. We found faster response times for within-room egocentric spatial judgments and behavioral priming effects of visiting the same room, providing evidence for a compartmentalized representation of space. At the neural level, we observed a hierarchical encoding of 3D spatial information, with left anterior hippocampus representing local information within a room, while retrosplenial cortex, parahippocampal cortex, and posterior hippocampus represented room information within the wider building. Of note, both our behavioral and neural findings showed that vertical and horizontal location information was similarly encoded, suggesting an isotropic representation of 3D space even in the context of a multicompartment environment. These findings provide much-needed information about how the human brain supports spatial memory and navigation in buildings with numerous levels and rooms.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

We found that tactile cue combination patterns and their sensitivity to the locations of the hands differed according to the attended stimulus feature. These idiosyncratic perceptual patterns can be explained by distinct cue combination models that each involve divisive normalization, a canonical computation.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283119v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Psychophysical inferences about the neural mechanisms supporting spatial vision can be undermined by uncertainties introduced by optical aberrations and fixational eye movements, particularly in fovea where the neuronal grain of the visual system is fine. We examined the effect of these pre-neural factors on photopic spatial summation in the human fovea using a custom adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope that provided control over optical aberrations and retinal stimulus motion. Consistent with previous results, Ricco's area of complete summation encompassed multiple photoreceptors when measured with ordinary amounts of ocular aberrations and retinal stimulus motion. When both factors were minimized experimentally, summation areas were essentially unchanged, suggesting that foveal spatial summation is limited by post-receptoral neural pooling. We compared our behavioral data to predictions generated with a physiologically-inspired front-end model of the visual system, and were able to capture the shape of the summation curves obtained with and without pre-retinal factors using a single post-receptoral summing filter of fixed spatial extent. Given our data and modeling, neurons in the magnocellular visual pathway, such as parasol ganglion cells, provide a candidate neural correlate of Ricco's area in the central fovea.</description>

	<description>Macaque dorsal occipital cortex is generally thought to contain one elongated third-tier area, V3d, extending along most of the rostral V2d border. In contrast, our submillimeter retinotopic fMRI maps (0.6 mm isotropic voxels, achieved by implanted phased-array receive coils) consistently show three sectors anterior to V2d. The dorsal (mirror-image) sector complies with the traditional V3d definition, and the middle (non-mirror image) sector with V3A. The ventral (mirror-image) sector bends away from V2d, as does VLP in marmosets and DLP in owl monkeys, and represents the entire contralateral hemifield like V3A. Its population receptive field size, however, suggests that this ventral sector is another fourth-tier area caudal to V4d. Hence, contrary to prevailing views, the retinotopic organization of cortex rostral to V2d differs substantially from widely accepted models. Instead, it is evolutionarily largely conserved in Old and New World monkeys.</description>

	<description>Sensory stimuli are encoded by the joint firing of neuronal groups composed of pyramidal cells and interneurons, rather than single isolated neurons. However, the principles by which these groups are organized to encode information remain poorly understood. A leading hypothesis is that similarly tuned pyramidal cells that preferentially connect to each other may form multi-cellular encoding units yoked to a similar purpose. The existence of such groups would be reflected on the profile of spontaneous events observed in neocortical networks. We used 2-photon calcium imaging to study spontaneous population-burst events in layer 2/3 of mouse area V1 during postnatal maturation. Throughout the period examined both size and duration of spontaneously occurring population-bursts formed scale-free distributions obeying a power law. The same was true for the degree of functional connectivity, a measure of pairwise synchrony across cells. These observations are consistent with a hierarchical small-world-net architecture, characterized by groups of cells with high local connectivity (small worlds, cliques) connected to each other via a restricted number of hub cells. To identify candidate small world groups we searched for cells whose calcium events had a consistent temporal relationship to events recorded from local inhibitory interneurons. This was guided by the intuition that groups of neurons whose synchronous firing represents a temporally coherent computational unit (or feature) ought to be inhibited together. This strategy allowed us to identify clusters of pyramidal neurons whose firing is temporally linked to one or more local interneurons. These small-world clusters did not remain static, during postnatal development: both cluster size and overlap with other clusters decreased over time as pyramidal neurons became progressively more selective, linking to fewer neighboring interneurons. Notably, pyramidal neurons in a cluster show higher tuning function similarity than expected with each other and with their linked interneurons. Our findings suggest that spontaneous population events in the visual cortex are shaped by small world networks of pyramidal neurons that share functional properties and work in concert with one or more local interneurons. We argue that such groups represent a fundamental neocortical unit of computation at the population level.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Shifted balance of dorsal versus ventral striatal communication with frontal reward and regulatory regions in cannabis dependence</title>

	<description>The transition from voluntary to addictive behavior is characterized by a loss of regulatory control in favor of reward driven behavior. Animal models indicate that this process is neurally underpinned by a shift in ventral to dorsal striatal control of behavior, however this shift has not been directly examined in humans. Against this background the present resting state fMRI study employed a two-step approach to (1) precisely map striatal alterations using a novel, data-driven network classification strategy combining Intrinsic Connectivity Contrast (ICC) with Multivoxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) and, (2) to determine whether a ventral to dorsal striatal shift in connectivity with reward and and regulatory control regions can be observed in abstinent (28 days) male cannabis-dependent individuals (n = 24) relative to matched controls (n = 28). Network classification revealed that the groups can be reliably discriminated by global connectivity profiles of two striatal regions that mapped onto the ventral (nucleus accumbens) and dorsal striatum (caudate). Subsequent functional connectivity analysis demonstrated a relative shift between ventral and dorsal striatal communication with fronto-limbic regions that have been consistently involved in reward processing (rostral ACC) and executive / regulatory functions (dorsomedial PFC). Specifically, in the cannabis dependent subjects connectivity between the ventral striatum with the rostral ACC increased, whereas both striatal regions were uncoupled from the regulatory dorsomedial PFC. Together these findings suggest a shift in the balance between dorsal and ventral striatal control in cannabis dependence. Similar changes have been observed in animal models and may promote the loss of control central to addictive behavior.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282871v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Plasticity related gene 1 encodes a cerebral neuron-specific synaptic transmembrane protein that modulates hippocampal excitatory transmission on glutamatergic neurons. In mice, homozygous Prg1-deficiency results in juvenile epilepsy. Screening a cohort of 18 patients with infantile spasms (West syndrome), we identified one patient with a heterozygous mutation in the highly conserved third extracellular phosphatase domain (p.T299S). The functional relevance of this mutation was verified by in-utero electroporation of a mutant Prg1 construct into neurons of Prg1-knockout embryos, and the subsequent inability of hippocampal neurons to rescue the knockout phenotype on the single cell level. Whole exome sequencing revealed the index patient to additionally harbor a novel heterozygous SCN1A variant (p.N541S) that was inherited from her healthy mother. Only the affected child carried both heterozygous PRG1 and SCN1A mutations. The aggravating effect of Prg1-haploinsufficiency on the epileptic phenotype was verified using the kainate-model of epilepsy. Double heterozygous Prg1(-/+)|Scn1a(wt/p.R1648H) mice exhibited higher seizure susceptibility than either wildtype, Prg1(-/+), or Scn1a(wt/p.R1648H) littermates. Our study provides evidence that PRG1-mutations have a potential modifying influence on SCN1A-related epilepsy in humans.</description>

	<description>Many brain functions depend on the ability of neural networks to temporally integrate transient inputs to produce sustained discharges. This can occur through cell-autonomous mechanisms in individual neurons or through reverberating activity in recurrently connected neural networks. We report a third mechanism involving temporal integration of neural activity by a network of astrocytes. Previously, we showed that some types of interneurons can generate long-lasting trains of action potentials for tens of seconds ('barrage firing') following repeated depolarizing stimuli. Here, we show that calcium signaling in an astrocytic network correlates with barrage firing; that active depolarization of astrocyte networks by chemical or optogenetic stimulation enhances barrage firing; and that chelating internal calcium, inhibiting release from internal stores, or inhibiting GABA transporters or metabotropic glutamate receptors inhibited barrage firing. Thus, through complex molecular processes, networks of interconnected astrocytes influence the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural networks by directly integrating neural activity and driving long-lasting barrages of action potentials in some populations of inhibitory interneurons.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282731v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The calcium-activated chloride channel anoctamin-2 (Ano2) is thought to amplify transduction currents in ORNs, a hypothesis supported by previous studies in dissociated neurons from Ano2-/- mice. Paradoxically, despite a reduction in transduction currents in Ano2-/- ORNs, their spike output for odor stimuli may be higher. We examined the role of Ano2 in ORNs in their native environment in freely breathing mice by imaging activity in ORN axons as they arrive in the olfactory bulb glomeruli. Odor-evoked responses in ORN axons of Ano2-/- mice were consistently larger for a variety of odorants and concentrations. In an open arena, Ano2-/- mice took longer to approach a localized odor source than wild-type mice, revealing clear olfactory behavioral deficits. Our studies provide the first in vivo evidence toward an alternative role for Ano2 in the olfactory transduction cascade, where it may serve as a feedback mechanism to clamp ORN spike output.</description>

	<description>Language acquisition appears to rely at least in part on recruiting pre-existing brain structures. We hypothesized that the neural substrate for language can be characterized by distinct, non-trivial network properties of the brain, that modulate language acquisition early in development. We tested whether these brain network properties present at the normal age of birth predicted later language abilities, and whether these were robust against perturbation by studying infants exposed to the extreme environmental stress of preterm birth. We found that brain network controllability and integration predicted respectively phonological, bottom-up and syntactical, top-down language skills at 20 months, and that syntactical but not phonological functions were modulated by premature extrauterine life. These data show that the neural substrate for language acquisition is a network property present at term corrected age. These distinct developmental trajectories may be relevant to the emergence of social interaction after birth.</description>

	<description>Absence epilepsy is a common childhood disorder featuring frequent cortical spike-wave seizures with a loss of awareness and behavior. Using the calcium indicator GCaMP6 with in vivo 2-photon cellular microscopy and simultaneous electrocorticography, we examined the collective activity profiles of individual neurons and surrounding neuropil across all layers in V1 during spike-wave seizure activity over prolonged periods in stargazer mice. We show that most (~80%) neurons in all cortical layers reduce their activity during seizures, whereas a smaller pool activates or remains neutral. Unexpectedly, ictal participation of identified single unit activity is not fixed, but fluctuates on a flexible time scale across seizures. Pairwise correlation analysis of calcium activity reveals a surprising lack of synchrony among neurons and neuropil patches in all layers during seizures. Our results demonstrate an asynchronous suppression of visual cortex during absence seizures, with major implications for understanding cortical network function during EEG states of reduced awareness.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: On the flexibility of basic risk attitudes in monkeys</title>

	<description>Monkeys and other animals appear to share with humans two risk attitudes predicted by prospect theory: an inverse-S-shaped probability weighting function and a steeper utility curve for losses than for gains. These findings suggest that such preferences are stable traits with common neural substrates. We hypothesized instead that animals tailor their preferences to subtle changes in task contexts, making risk attitudes flexible. Previous studies used a limited number of outcomes, trial types, and contexts. To gain a broader perspective, we examined two large datasets of male macaques' risky choices: one from a task with real (juice) gains and another from a token task with gains and losses. In contrast to previous findings, monkeys were risk-seeking for both gains and losses (i.e. lacked a reflection effect) and showed steeper gain than loss curves (loss-seeking). Utility curves for gains were substantially different in the two tasks. Monkeys showed nearly linear probability weightings in one task and S-shaped ones in the other; neither task produced a consistent inverse-S-shaped curve. To account for these observations, we developed and tested various computational models of the processes involved in the construction of reward value. We found that adaptive differential weighting of prospective gamble outcomes could partially account for the observed differences in the utility functions across the two experiments and thus, provide a plausible mechanism underlying flexible risk attitudes. Together, our results support the idea that risky choices are flexibly constructed at the time of elicitation and place important constraints on neural models of economic choice.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Progressive impairment of directional and spatially precise trajectories by TgF344-AD Rats in the Morris Water Task</title>

	<description>Spatial navigation is impaired in early stages of Alzheimers disease (AD), and may be a defining behavioral marker of preclinical AD. Nevertheless, limitations of diagnostic criteria for AD and within animal models of AD make characterization of preclinical AD difficult. A new rat model (TgF344-AD) of AD overcomes many of these limitations, though spatial navigation has not been comprehensively assessed. Using the hidden and cued platform variants of the Morris water task, a longitudinal assessment of spatial navigation was conducted on TgF344-AD (n=16) and Fischer 344 (n=12) male and female rats at three age ranges: 4 to 5 months, 7 to 8, and 10 to 11 months of age. TgF344-AD rats exhibited largely intact navigation at 4-5 and 7-8 months of age, with deficits in the hidden platform task emerging at 10-11 months of age. In general, TgF344-AD rats displayed less accurate swim trajectories to the platform and a wider search area around the platform region compared to wildtype rats. Impaired navigation occurred in the absence of deficits in acquiring the procedural task demands or navigation to the cued platform location. Together, the results indicate that TgF344-AD rats exhibit comparable deficits to those found in individuals in the early stages of AD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: High frequency electrical stimulation induces a long-lasting enhancement of event-related potentials but does not change the perception elicited by intra-epidermal electrical stimuli delivered to the area of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282335v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>High frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) of the skin induces increased pinprick sensitivity in the surrounding unconditioned skin (secondary hyperalgesia). Moreover, it has been shown that brief high intensity CO2 laser stimuli, activating both A{delta}- and C-fiber nociceptors, are perceived as more intense when delivered in the area of secondary hyperalgesia. To investigate the contribution of A-fiber nociceptors to secondary hyperalgesia the present study assessed if the perception and brain responses elicited by low-intensity intra-epidermal electrical stimulation (IES), a method preferentially activating A{delta}-fiber nociceptors, are increased in the area of secondary hyperalgesia. HFS was delivered to one of the two forearms of seventeen healthy volunteers. Mechanical pinprick stimulation and IES were delivered at both arms before HFS (T0), 20 minutes after HFS (T1) and 45 minutes after HFS (T2). In all participants, HFS induced an increase in pinprick perception at the HFS-treated arm, adjacent to the site of HFS. This increase was significant at both T1 and T2. HFS did not affect the percept elicited by IES, but did enhance the magnitude of the N2 wave of IES-evoked brain potentials, both at T1 and at T2. HFS induced a long-lasting enhancement of the N2 wave elicited by IES in the area of secondary hyperalgesia, indicating that HFS enhances the responsiveness of the central nervous system to nociceptive inputs conveyed by AMH-II nociceptors. However, we found no evidence that HFS affects the perception elicited by IES, which may suggest that AMH-II nociceptors do not contribute to HFS-induced secondary hyperalgesia.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Arimoclomol as a potential therapy for neuronopathic Gaucher Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281824v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281824v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Gaucher Disease is caused by mutations of the GBA gene which affects the function of the encoded lysosomal enzyme acid beta-glucosidase by primarily perturbing its protein homeostasis. Heat shock proteins are well known cytoprotective molecules with functions in protein homeostasis and lysosomal function. The investigational drug arimoclomol is a well-characterized HSP amplifier and has been extensively clinically tested. Importantly, arimoclomol efficiently crosses the blood-brain-barrier presenting an opportunity to target the neurological manifestations of GD, which remains without a disease-modifying therapy. In the present study, we found that arimoclomol induced relevant HSPs such as ER-resident HSP70 (BiP) and enhanced the folding, maturation, activity and correct cellular localization of mutated GCase across several genotypes including the common L444P and N370S mutations in primary cells from GD patients. These effects where recapitulated in a human neuronal model of GD obtained by differentiation of multipotent adult stem cells. These data demonstrate the potential of HSP-targeting therapies in GCase-deficiencies and strongly support the clinical development of arimoclomol as a potential first therapeutic option for the neuronopathic forms of GD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Estimating mechanical properties of cloth from videos using dense motion trajectories: human psychophysics and machine learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238782v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/238782v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Humans can visually estimate the mechanical properties of deformable objects (e.g. cloth stiffness). While much of the recent work on material perception has focused on static image cues (e.g., textures and shape), little is known whether humans can integrate information over time to make a judgment. Here, we investigate the effect of spatiotemporal information across multiple frames (multi-frame motion) on estimating the bending stiffness of cloth. Using high-fidelity cloth animations, we first examined how the perceived bending stiffness changed as a function of the physical bending stiffness defined in the simulation model. Using maximum likelihood difference scaling methods (MLDS) we found that the perceived stiffness and the physical bending stiffness were highly correlated. A second experiment in which we scrambled the frame sequences diminished this correlation. This suggests that multi-frame motion plays an important role. To provide further evidence for this finding, we extracted dense motion trajectories from the videos across 15 consecutive frames and used the trajectory descriptors to train a machine-learning model with the measured perceptual scales. The model can predict human perceptual scales in new videos with varied winds, optical properties of cloth, and scene setups. When the correct multi-frame was removed (using either scrambled videos or 2-frame optical flow to train the model), the predictions significantly worsened. Our findings demonstrate that multi-frame motion information is important for both humans and machines to estimate the mechanical properties. In addition, we show that dense motion trajectories are effective features to build a successful automatic cloth estimation system.</description>

The Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) software reconstructs dynamic regulatory networks by integrating static protein-DNA interaction data with time series gene expression data. In recent years, several additional types of high-throughput time series data have been profiled when studying biological processes including time series miRNA expression, proteomics, epigenomics and single cell RNA-Seq. Combining all available time series and static datasets in a unified model remains an important challenge and goal. To address this challenge we have developed a new version of DREM termed interactive DREM (iDREM). iDREM provides support for all data types mentioned above and combines them with existing interaction data to reconstruct networks that can lead to novel hypotheses on the function and timing of regulators. Users can interactively visualize and query the resulting model. We showcase the functionality of the new tool by applying it to microglia developmental data from multiple labs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/73xX3n_LGQE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Epileptiform activity in traumatic brain injury predicts post-traumatic epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hypothesize that epileptiform abnormalities (EA) in the electroencephalopgram (EEG) during the acute period following traumatic brain injury (TBI) independently predict first-year post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). We analyzed PTE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; risk factors in two cohorts matched for TBI severity and age (n=50). EA independently predict risk for PTE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (OR 3.16[0.99 11.68]); subdural hematoma is another independent risk factor (OR 4.13 [1.18 39.33]). Differences in EA rates are apparent within 5 days following TBI. Our results suggest increased EA prevalence identifies patients at increased risk for PTE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and that EA acutely post-TBI can identify patients most likely to benefit from anti-epileptogenesis drug trials.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Bilateral taste disorders in patients with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and Bell's Palsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25210</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25210</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) and Bell's palsy (BP) are typically known as facial nerve motor syndromes and are primarily unilateral. The aim of this study was to challenge this assertion because both conditions are also known to be associated with viruses that typically affect several nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Ten participants with RHS, 12 with BP, all clinically unilateral, and 12 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. Electrogustometric thresholds were measured bilaterally in the areas of the chorda tympani, the glossopharyngeal, and the major petrosal nerve. Also bilaterally, the taste function was tested using chemogustometry with different tastant concentrations. Again bilaterally, the morphology of the mucosa and the vessels of the anterior fungiform papillae were examined by contact endoscopy. Statistically, RHS and BP participants were compared with the healthy controls, and the paretic sides of RHS and BP were compared pairwise with their mobile sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Electrogustometrically, the perception was reduced bilaterally in RHS (10-19 dB, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and BP (3-5 dB, p = 0.011 to 0.030) in all three innervation areas. Chemogustometrically, it was also reduced bilaterally in RHS (20-70%) and BP (8-50%). Papillary atrophies were 100% increased in RHS (p = 0.001) and BP (p &amp;lt; 0.001). They were more increased on the paretic side in RHS (30%, p = 0.078) and BP (83%, p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: In these two clinically unilateral conditions, the gustatory perception and morphology are bilaterally affected, namely more in RHS and more on the paretic side. BP, known as an isolated motor condition, appears to be a cranial polyneuritis. A bilateral examination and therapeutic gustatory monitoring might follow these observations in evidence-based practice. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The Nerve Conditioning Lesion – a Strategy to Enhance Nerve Regeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By altering the intrinsic metabolism of the cell, including the upregulation of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs) and the production of structural proteins for axonal outgrowth, the conditioning lesion sets up an environment highly conducive to regeneration. In this review, we assess forty years of research to provide a comprehensive overview of the conditioning lesion literature, directed at: a) discussing the mechanisms of, and barriers to nerve regeneration that can be mitigated by the conditioning lesion; b) describing the cellular and molecular pathways implicated in the conditioning lesion effect; and c) deliberating on how these insights might be applied clinically. The consequential impact on regeneration is profound, with a conditioned nerve demonstrating longer neurite extensions &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, enhanced expression of RAGs within the dorsal root ganglia, early assembly and transportation of cytoskeletal elements, accelerated axonal growth, and improved functional recovery &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Although this promising technique is not yet feasible to be performed in humans, there are potential strategies, such as conditioning electrical stimulation that may be explored to allow nerve conditioning in a clinically safe and well-tolerated manner.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Role of Mesolimbic Circuitry in Buffering Election-Related Distress</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The 2016 U.S. presidential election yielded distress among many individuals who identify with historically marginalized groups. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychological measures to test the hypotheses that neural response to reward, probing the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and social support would ameliorate the effects of election distress among those who felt negatively affected by the result. Within 4 months of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we tested human participants who felt affected by the election result (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 40, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 21.9 years, 28 female) and control participants (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 20.25 years, 12 female) who did not feel affected by the election result. Election-related distress significantly differed between the groups, and distress accounted for over half of the relationship between discrimination experiences and depression symptoms among affected individuals. NAcc activation, connectivity between the NAcc and mPFC, and family support moderated the associations between election distress and depression symptoms. Prior work has primarily investigated mesolimbic circuitry in reward and motivation contexts, but our findings extend the relevance of functioning in this circuitry to ameliorating psychological manifestations of acute distress after shifts in political climate. These findings highlight the psychological effects of this important historic event and identify neurobiological and social mechanisms associated with individual differences in response to election distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The 2016 U.S. presidential election was psychologically distressing for many individuals. In this study, election-related distress was linked to depression symptomology for affected individuals but not control individuals. However, among individuals distressed by the election, those with greater neural response to reward and higher family support were protected against these depressive symptoms. Previous research has examined how neural response to reward after a discrete event ameliorates clinical symptoms. The current study extends this knowledge by demonstrating that both the brain and social support may play influential roles in dampening affective responses to ongoing and anticipated distress related to political climate. Leveraging this finding to enact interventions that dampen continuous distress, political or otherwise, is a promising endeavor for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Maternal Immune Activation During the Third Trimester Is Associated with Neonatal Functional Connectivity of the Salience Network and Fetal to Toddler Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2877?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2877?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prenatal maternal immune activation (MIA) is associated with altered brain development and risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring. Translational human studies of MIA are few in number. Alterations of the salience network have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the same psychiatric disorders associated with MIA. If MIA is pathogenic, then associated abnormalities in the salience network should be detectable in neonates immediately after birth. We tested the hypothesis that third trimester MIA of adolescent women who are at risk for high stress and inflammation is associated with the strength of functional connectivity in the salience network of their neonate. Thirty-six women underwent blood draws to measure interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and electrocardiograms to measure fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) at 34–37 weeks gestation. Resting-state imaging data were acquired in the infants at 40–44 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Functional connectivity was measured from seeds placed in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. Measures of cognitive development were obtained at 14 months PMA using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development–Third Edition (BSID-III). Both sexes were studied. Regions in which the strength of the salience network correlated with maternal IL-6 or CRP levels included the medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, and basal ganglia. Maternal CRP level correlated inversely with FHRV acquired at the same gestational age. Maternal CRP and IL-6 levels correlated positively with measures of cognitive development on the BSID-III. These results suggest that MIA is associated with short- and long-term influences on offspring brain and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Preclinical studies in rodents and nonhuman primates and epidemiological studies in humans suggest that maternal immune activation (MIA) alters the development of brain circuitry and associated behaviors, placing offspring at risk for psychiatric illness. Consistent with preclinical findings, we show that maternal third trimester interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein levels are associated with neonatal functional connectivity and with both fetal and toddler behavior. MIA-related functional connectivity was localized to the salience, default mode, and frontoparietal networks, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Our results suggest that MIA alters functional connectivity in the neonatal brain, that those alterations have consequences for cognition, and that these findings may provide pathogenetic links between preclinical and epidemiological studies associating MIA with psychiatric risk in offspring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Control of Homeostatic Synaptic Plasticity by AKAP-Anchored Kinase and Phosphatase Regulation of Ca2+-Permeable AMPA Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2863?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2863?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal information processing requires multiple forms of synaptic plasticity mediated by NMDARs and AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). These plasticity mechanisms include long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which are Hebbian, homosynaptic mechanisms locally regulating synaptic strength of specific inputs, and homeostatic synaptic scaling, which is a heterosynaptic mechanism globally regulating synaptic strength across all inputs. In many cases, LTP and homeostatic scaling regulate AMPAR subunit composition to increase synaptic strength via incorporation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable receptors (CP-AMPAR) containing GluA1, but lacking GluA2, subunits. Previous work by our group and others demonstrated that anchoring of the kinase PKA and the phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) to A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 150 play opposing roles in regulation of GluA1 Ser845 phosphorylation and CP-AMPAR synaptic incorporation during hippocampal LTP and LTD. Here, using both male and female knock-in mice that are deficient in PKA or CaN anchoring, we show that AKAP150-anchored PKA and CaN also play novel roles in controlling CP-AMPAR synaptic incorporation during homeostatic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. We found that genetic disruption of AKAP-PKA anchoring prevented increases in Ser845 phosphorylation and CP-AMPAR synaptic recruitment during rapid homeostatic synaptic scaling-up induced by combined blockade of action potential firing and NMDAR activity. In contrast, genetic disruption of AKAP-CaN anchoring resulted in basal increases in Ser845 phosphorylation and CP-AMPAR synaptic activity that blocked subsequent scaling-up by preventing additional CP-AMPAR recruitment. Thus, the balanced, opposing phospho-regulation provided by AKAP-anchored PKA and CaN is essential for control of both Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that require CP-AMPARs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuronal circuit function is shaped by multiple forms of activity-dependent plasticity that control excitatory synaptic strength, including LTP/LTD that adjusts strength of individual synapses and homeostatic plasticity that adjusts overall strength of all synapses. Mechanisms controlling LTP/LTD and homeostatic plasticity were originally thought to be distinct; however, recent studies suggest that CP-AMPAR phosphorylation regulation is important during both LTP/LTD and homeostatic plasticity. Here we show that CP-AMPAR regulation by the kinase PKA and phosphatase CaN coanchored to the scaffold protein AKAP150, a mechanism previously implicated in LTP/LTD, is also crucial for controlling synaptic strength during homeostatic plasticity. These novel findings significantly expand our understanding of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms and further emphasize how intertwined they are with LTP and LTD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Information Present in Infragranular Layers of Mouse Auditory Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex is a major hub for the convergence and integration of signals from across the sensory modalities; sensory cortices, including primary regions, are no exception. Here we show that visual stimuli influence neural firing in the auditory cortex of awake male and female mice, using multisite probes to sample single units across multiple cortical layers. We demonstrate that visual stimuli influence firing in both primary and secondary auditory cortex. We then determine the laminar location of recording sites through electrode track tracing with fluorescent dye and optogenetic identification using layer-specific markers. Spiking responses to visual stimulation occur deep in auditory cortex and are particularly prominent in layer 6. Visual modulation of firing rate occurs more frequently at areas with secondary-like auditory responses than those with primary-like responses. Auditory cortical responses to drifting visual gratings are not orientation-tuned, unlike visual cortex responses. The deepest cortical layers thus appear to be an important locus for cross-modal integration in auditory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The deepest layers of the auditory cortex are often considered its most enigmatic, possessing a wide range of cell morphologies and atypical sensory responses. Here we show that, in mouse auditory cortex, these layers represent a locus of cross-modal convergence, containing many units responsive to visual stimuli. Our results suggest that this visual signal conveys the presence and timing of a stimulus rather than specifics about that stimulus, such as its orientation. These results shed light on both how and what types of cross-modal information is integrated at the earliest stages of sensory cortical processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Decoding of Bistable Sounds Reveals an Effect of Intention on Perceptual Organization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2844?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2844?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Auditory signals arrive at the ear as a mixture that the brain must decompose into distinct sources based to a large extent on acoustic properties of the sounds. An important question concerns whether listeners have voluntary control over how many sources they perceive. This has been studied using pure high (H) and low (L) tones presented in the repeating pattern HLH-HLH-, which can form a bistable percept heard either as an integrated whole (HLH-) or as segregated into high (H-H-) and low (-L-) sequences. Although instructing listeners to try to integrate or segregate sounds affects reports of what they hear, this could reflect a response bias rather than a perceptual effect. We had human listeners (15 males, 12 females) continuously report their perception of such sequences and recorded neural activity using MEG. During neutral listening, a classifier trained on patterns of neural activity distinguished between periods of integrated and segregated perception. In other conditions, participants tried to influence their perception by allocating attention either to the whole sequence or to a subset of the sounds. They reported hearing the desired percept for a greater proportion of time than when listening neutrally. Critically, neural activity supported these reports; stimulus-locked brain responses in auditory cortex were more likely to resemble the signature of segregation when participants tried to hear segregation than when attempting to perceive integration. These results indicate that listeners can influence how many sound sources they perceive, as reflected in neural responses that track both the input and its perceptual organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Can we consciously influence our perception of the external world? We address this question using sound sequences that can be heard either as coming from a single source or as two distinct auditory streams. Listeners reported spontaneous changes in their perception between these two interpretations while we recorded neural activity to identify signatures of such integration and segregation. They also indicated that they could, to some extent, choose between these alternatives. This claim was supported by corresponding changes in responses in auditory cortex. By linking neural and behavioral correlates of perception, we demonstrate that the number of objects that we perceive can depend not only on the physical attributes of our environment, but also on how we intend to experience it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multisensory Integration Enhances Temporal Coding in Ventral Cochlear Nucleus Bushy Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2832?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2832?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Temporal coding of auditory stimuli is critical for understanding communication signals. The bushy cell, a major output neuron of the ventral cochlear nucleus, can &quot;phase-lock&quot; precisely to pure tones and the envelopes of complex stimuli. Bushy cells are also putative recipients of brainstem somatosensory projections and could therefore play a role in perception of communication signals because multisensory integration is required for such complex sound processing. Here, we examine the role of multisensory integration in temporal coding in bushy cells by activating the spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5) while recording responses from bushy cells. In normal-hearing guinea pigs of either sex, bushy cell single unit responses to amplitude-modulated (AM) broadband noise were compared with those in the presence of preceding Sp5 electrical stimulation (i.e., bimodal stimuli). Responses to the AM stimuli were also compared with those obtained 45 min after the bimodal stimulation. Bimodal auditory–Sp5 stimulation resulted in enhanced envelope coding for low modulation frequencies, which persisted for up to 45 min. AM detection thresholds were significantly improved 45 min after bimodal auditory–Sp5 stimulation, but not during bimodal auditory–Sp5 stimulation. Anterograde labeling of Sp5 projections was found within the dendritic fields of bushy cells and their inhibitory interneurons, D-stellate cells. Therefore, enhanced AM responses and improved AM sensitivity of bushy cells were likely facilitated by Sp5 neurons through monosynaptic excitatory projections and indirect inhibitory projections. These somatosensory projections may be involved in the improved perception of communication stimuli with multisensory stimulation, consistent with psychophysical studies in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Multisensory integration is crucial for sensory coding because it improves sensitivity to unimodal stimuli and enhances responses to external stimuli. Although multisensory integration has typically been described in the cerebral cortex, the cochlear nucleus in the brainstem is also innervated by multiple sensory systems, including the somatosensory and auditory systems. Here, we showed that convergence of these two sensory systems in the cochlear nucleus results in improved temporal coding in bushy cells, principal output neurons that send projections to higher auditory structures. The improved temporal coding instilled by bimodal auditory–Sp5 stimulation may be important in priming the neurons for coding biologically relevant sounds such as communication signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Missense Mutation A384P Associated with Human Hyperekplexia Reveals a Desensitization Site of Glycine Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2818?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2818?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hyperekplexia, an inherited neuronal disorder characterized by exaggerated startle responses with unexpected sensory stimuli, is caused by dysfunction of glycinergic inhibitory transmission. From analysis of newly identified human hyperekplexia mutations in the glycine receptor (GlyR) α1 subunit, we found that an alanine-to-proline missense mutation (A384P) resulted in substantially higher desensitization level and lower agonist sensitivity of homomeric α1 GlyRs when expressed in HEK cells. The incorporation of the β subunit fully reversed the reduction in agonist sensitivity and partially reversed the desensitization of α1&lt;sup&gt;A384P&lt;/sup&gt;. The heteromeric α1&lt;sup&gt;A384P&lt;/sup&gt;β GlyRs showed enhanced desensitization but unchanged agonist-induced maximum responses, surface expression, main channel conductance, and voltage dependence compared with that of the wild-type α1β (α1&lt;sup&gt;WT&lt;/sup&gt;β) GlyRs. Coexpression of the R392H and A384P mutant α1 subunits, which mimic the expression of the compound heterozygous mutation in a hyperekplexia patient, resulted in channel properties similar to those with α1&lt;sup&gt;A384P&lt;/sup&gt; subunit expression alone. In comparison, another human hyperekplexia mutation α1&lt;sup&gt;P250T&lt;/sup&gt;, which was previously reported to enhance desensitization, caused a strong reduction in maximum currents in addition to the altered desensitization. These results were further confirmed by overexpression of α1&lt;sup&gt;P250T&lt;/sup&gt; or α1&lt;sup&gt;A384P&lt;/sup&gt; subunits in cultured neurons isolated from SD rats of either sex. Moreover, the IPSC-like responses of cells expressing α1&lt;sup&gt;A384P&lt;/sup&gt;β induced by repeated glycine pulses showed a stronger frequency-dependent reduction than those expressing α1&lt;sup&gt;WT&lt;/sup&gt;β. Together, our findings demonstrate that A384 is associated with the desensitization site of the α1 subunit and its proline mutation produced enhanced desensitization of GlyRs, which contributes to the pathogenesis of human hyperekplexia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Human startle disease is caused by impaired synaptic inhibition in the brainstem and spinal cord, which is due to either direct loss of GlyR channel function or reduced number of synaptic GlyRs. Considering that fast decay kinetics of GlyR-mediated inhibitory synaptic responses, the question was raised whether altered desensitization of GlyRs will cause dysfunction of glycine transmission and disease phenotypes. Here, we found that the α1 subunit mutation A384P, identified from startle disease patients, results in enhanced desensitization and leads to rapidly decreasing responses in the mutant GlyRs when they are activated repeatedly by the synaptic-like simulation. These observations suggest that the enhanced desensitization of postsynaptic GlyRs could be the primary pathogenic mechanism of human startle disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Longitudinal Trajectory of Default Mode Network Connectivity in Healthy Older Adults Varies As a Function of Age and Is Associated with Changes in Episodic Memory and Processing Speed</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2809?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2809?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The default mode network (DMN) supports memory functioning and may be sensitive to preclinical Alzheimer's pathology. Little is known, however, about the longitudinal trajectory of this network's intrinsic functional connectivity (FC). In this study, we evaluated longitudinal FC in 111 cognitively normal older human adults (ages 49–87, 46 women/65 men), 92 of whom had at least three task-free fMRI scans (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 353 total scans). Whole-brain FC and three DMN subnetworks were assessed: (1) within-DMN, (2) between anterior and posterior DMN, and (3) between medial temporal lobe network and posterior DMN. Linear mixed-effects models demonstrated significant baseline age &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; time interactions, indicating a nonlinear trajectory. There was a trend toward increasing FC between ages 50–66 and significantly accelerating declines after age 74. A similar interaction was observed for whole-brain FC. &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; status did not predict baseline connectivity or change in connectivity. After adjusting for network volume, changes in within-DMN connectivity were specifically associated with changes in episodic memory and processing speed but not working memory or executive functions. The relationship with processing speed was attenuated after covarying for white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and whole-brain FC, whereas within-DMN connectivity remained associated with memory above and beyond WMH and whole-brain FC. Whole-brain and DMN FC exhibit a nonlinear trajectory, with more rapid declines in older age and possibly increases in connectivity early in the aging process. Within-DMN connectivity is a marker of episodic memory performance even among cognitively healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Default mode network and whole-brain connectivity, measured using task-free fMRI, changed nonlinearly as a function of age, with some suggestion of early increases in connectivity. For the first time, longitudinal changes in DMN connectivity were shown to correlate with changes in episodic memory, whereas volume changes in relevant brain regions did not. This relationship was not accounted for by white matter hyperintensities or mean whole-brain connectivity. Functional connectivity may be an early biomarker of changes in aging but should be used with caution given its nonmonotonic nature, which could complicate interpretation. Future studies investigating longitudinal network changes should consider whole-brain changes in connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Protein Kinase C Enhances Electrical Synaptic Transmission by Acting on Junctional and Postsynaptic Ca2+ Currents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2796?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2796?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;By synchronizing neuronal activity, electrical transmission influences the coordination, pattern, and/or frequency of firing. In the hemaphroditic marine-snail, &lt;i&gt;Aplysia calfornica&lt;/i&gt;, the neuroendocrine bag cell neurons use electrical synapses to synchronize a 30 min afterdischarge of action potentials for the release of reproductive hormone. During the afterdischarge, protein kinase C (PKC) is activated, although its impact on bag cell neuron electrical transmission is unknown. This was investigated here by monitoring electrical synapses between paired cultured bag cell neurons using dual whole-cell recording. Voltage clamp revealed a largely voltage-independent junctional current, which was enhanced by treating with a PKC activator, PMA, before recording. We also examined the transfer of presynaptic action potential-like waveforms (generated in voltage clamp) to the postsynaptic cell (measured in current clamp). For control pairs, the presynaptic spike-like waveforms mainly evoked electrotonic potentials; however, when PKC was triggered, these stimuli consistently produced postsynaptic action potentials. To assess whether this involved changes to postsynaptic responsiveness, single bag cell neurons were injected with junctional-like current mimicking that evoked by a presynaptic action potential. Unlike control neurons, which were less likely to spike, cells in PMA always fired action potentials to the junctional-like current. Furthermore, PKC activation increased a postsynaptic voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current, which was recruited even by modest depolarization associated with an electrotonic potential. Whereas PKC inhibits gap junctions in most systems, bag cell neurons are rather unique, as the kinase potentiates the electrical synapse; in turn, this synergizes with augmented postsynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current to promote synchronous firing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Electrical coupling is a fundamental form of communication. For the bag cell neurons of &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;, electrical synapses coordinate a prolonged burst of action potentials known as the afterdischarge. We looked at how protein kinase C, which is upregulated with the afterdischarge, influences information transfer across the synapse. The kinase activation increased junctional current, a remarkable finding given that this enzyme is largely considered inhibitory for gap junctions. There was also an augmentation in the ability of a presynaptic neuron to provoke postsynaptic action potentials. This increased excitability was, in part, due to enhanced postsynaptic voltage-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current. Thus, protein kinase C improves the fidelity of electrotonic transmission and promotes synchronous firing by modulating both junctional and membrane conductances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Rescue of Learning and Memory Deficits in the Human Nonsyndromic Intellectual Disability Cereblon Knock-Out Mouse Model by Targeting the AMP-Activated Protein Kinase-mTORC1 Translational Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2780?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A homozygous nonsense mutation in the cereblon (&lt;i&gt;CRBN&lt;/i&gt;) gene results in autosomal recessive, nonsyndromic intellectual disability that is devoid of other phenotypic features, suggesting a critical role of CRBN in mediating learning and memory. In this study, we demonstrate that adult male &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt; knock-out (&lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt;) mice exhibit deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks that are recapitulated by focal knock-out of Crbn in the adult dorsal hippocampus, with no changes in social or repetitive behavior. Cellular studies identify deficits in long-term potentiation at Schaffer collateral CA1 synapses. We further show that &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt; is robustly expressed in the mouse hippocampus and &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibit hyperphosphorylated levels of AMPKα (Thr172). Examination of processes downstream of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) finds that &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; mice have a selective impairment in mediators of the mTORC1 translation initiation pathway in parallel with lower protein levels of postsynaptic density glutamatergic proteins and higher levels of excitatory presynaptic markers in the hippocampus with no change in markers of the unfolded protein response or autophagy pathways. Acute pharmacological inhibition of AMPK activity in adult &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; mice rescues learning and memory deficits and normalizes hippocampal mTORC1 activity and postsynaptic glutamatergic proteins without altering excitatory presynaptic markers. Thus, this study identifies that loss of &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt; results in learning, memory, and synaptic defects as a consequence of exaggerated AMPK activity, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, and decreased glutamatergic synaptic proteins. Thus, &lt;i&gt;Crbn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; mice serve as an ideal model of intellectual disability to further explore molecular mechanisms of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Intellectual disability (ID) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders. The cereblon (&lt;i&gt;CRBN&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been linked to autosomal recessive, nonsyndromic ID, characterized by an intelligence quotient between 50 and 70 but devoid of other phenotypic features, making cereblon an ideal protein for the study of the fundamental aspects of learning and memory. Here, using the cereblon knock-out mouse model, we show that cereblon deficiency disrupts learning, memory, and synaptic function via AMP-activated protein kinase hyperactivity, downregulation of mTORC1, and dysregulation of excitatory synapses, with no changes in social or repetitive behaviors, consistent with findings in the human population. This establishes the cereblon knock-out mouse as a model of pure ID without the confounding behavioral phenotypes associated with other current models of ID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Aversive Learning Compromises Sensory Discrimination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2766?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2766?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aversive learning is thought to modulate perceptual thresholds, which can lead to overgeneralization. However, it remains undetermined whether this modulation is domain specific or a general effect. Moreover, despite the unique role of the visual modality in human perception, it is unclear whether this aspect of aversive learning exists in this modality. The current study was designed to examine the effect of visual aversive outcomes on the perception of basic visual and auditory features. We tested the ability of healthy participants, both males and females, to discriminate between neutral stimuli, before and after visual learning. In each experiment, neutral stimuli were associated with aversive images in an experimental group and with neutral images in a control group. Participants demonstrated a deterioration in discrimination (higher discrimination thresholds) only after aversive learning. This deterioration was measured for both auditory (tone frequency) and visual (orientation and contrast) features. The effect was replicated in five different experiments and lasted for at least 24 h. fMRI neural responses and pupil size were also measured during learning. We showed an increase in neural activations in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and amygdala during aversive compared with neutral learning. Interestingly, the early visual cortex showed increased brain activity during aversive compared with neutral context trials, with identical visual information. Our findings imply the existence of a central multimodal mechanism, which modulates early perceptual properties, following exposure to negative situations. Such a mechanism could contribute to abnormal responses that underlie anxiety states, even in new and safe environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Using a visual aversive-learning paradigm, we found deteriorated discrimination abilities for visual and auditory stimuli that were associated with visual aversive stimuli. We showed increased neural activations in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and amygdala during aversive learning, compared with neutral learning. Importantly, similar findings were also evident in the early visual cortex during trials with aversive/neutral context, but with identical visual information. The demonstration of this phenomenon in the visual modality is important, as it provides support to the notion that aversive learning can influence perception via a central mechanism, independent of input modality. Given the dominance of the visual system in human perception, our findings hold relevance to daily life, as well as imply a potential etiology for anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Primacy of Spatial Context in the Neural Representation of Events</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2755?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2755?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Some theories of episodic memory hypothesize that spatial context plays a fundamental role in episodic memory, acting as a scaffold on which episodes are constructed. A prediction based on this hypothesis is that spatial context should play a primary role in the neural representation of an event. To test this hypothesis in humans, male and female participants imagined events, composed of familiar locations, people, and objects, during an fMRI scan. We used multivoxel pattern analysis to determine the neural areas in which events could be discriminated based on each feature. We found that events could be discriminated according to their location in areas throughout the autobiographical memory network, including the parahippocampal cortex and posterior hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortex. Events were also discriminable based on person and object features, but in fewer regions. Comparing classifier performance in regions involved in memory for scenes and events demonstrated that the location of an event was more accurately classified than the person or object involved. These results support theories that suggest that spatial context is a prominent defining feature of episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Remembered and imagined events are complex, consisting of many elements, including people, objects, and locations. In this study, we sought to determine how these types of elements differentially contribute to how the brain represents an event. Participants imagined events consisting of familiar locations, people, and objects (e.g., kitchen, mom, umbrella) while their brain activity was recorded with fMRI. We found that the neural patterns of activity in brain regions associated with spatial and episodic memory could distinguish events based on their location, and to some extent, based on the people and objects involved. These results suggest that the spatial context of an event plays an important role in how an event is represented in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mind-Wandering in People with Hippocampal Damage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2745?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2745?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Subjective inner experiences, such as mind-wandering, represent the fundaments of human cognition. Although the precise function of mind-wandering is still debated, it is increasingly acknowledged to have influence across cognition on processes such as future planning, creative thinking, and problem-solving and even on depressive rumination and other mental health disorders. Recently, there has been important progress in characterizing mind-wandering and identifying the associated neural networks. Two prominent features of mind-wandering are mental time travel and visuospatial imagery, which are often linked with the hippocampus. People with selective bilateral hippocampal damage cannot vividly recall events from their past, envision their future, or imagine fictitious scenes. This raises the question of whether the hippocampus plays a causal role in mind-wandering and, if so, in what way. Leveraging a unique opportunity to shadow people (all males) with bilateral hippocampal damage for several days, we examined, for the first time, what they thought about spontaneously, without direct task demands. We found that they engaged in as much mind-wandering as control participants. However, whereas controls thought about the past, present, and future, imagining vivid visual scenes, hippocampal damage resulted in thoughts primarily about the present comprising verbally mediated semantic knowledge. These findings expose the hippocampus as a key pillar in the neural architecture of mind-wandering and also reveal its impact beyond episodic memory, placing it at the heart of our mental life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans tend to mind-wander ~30–50% of their waking time. Two prominent features of this pervasive form of thought are mental time travel and visuospatial imagery, which are often associated with the hippocampus. To examine whether the hippocampus plays a causal role in mind-wandering, we examined the frequency and phenomenology of mind-wandering in patients with selective bilateral hippocampal damage. We found that they engaged in as much mind-wandering as controls. However, hippocampal damage changed the form and content of mind-wandering from flexible, episodic, and scene based to abstract, semanticized, and verbal. These findings expose the hippocampus as a key pillar in the neural architecture of mind-wandering and reveal its impact beyond episodic memory, placing it at the heart of our mental life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Large Visual Stimuli Induce Two Distinct Gamma Oscillations in Primate Visual Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have shown the existence of two gamma rhythms in the hippocampus subserving different functions but, to date, primate studies in primary visual cortex have reported a single gamma rhythm. Here, we show that large visual stimuli induce a slow gamma (25–45 Hz) in area V1 of two awake adult female bonnet monkeys and in the EEG of 15 human subjects (7 males and 8 females), in addition to the traditionally known fast gamma (45–70 Hz). The two rhythms had different tuning characteristics for stimulus orientation, contrast, drift speed, and size. Further, fast gamma had short latency, strongly entrained spikes and was coherent over short distances, reflecting short-range processing, whereas slow gamma appeared to reflect long-range processing. Together, two gamma rhythms can potentially provide better coding or communication mechanisms and a more comprehensive biomarker for diagnosis of mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Gamma rhythm has been associated with high-level cognitive functions such as attention and feature binding and has been reported to be abnormal in brain disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Unlike previous studies that have shown a single gamma rhythm in the primate visual cortex, we found that large visual gratings induce two distinct gamma oscillations in both monkey LFP and human EEG. These rhythms, termed slow (25–45 Hz) and fast (45–70 Hz), exhibited distinct tuning preferences, latencies, and coherence profiles, potentially reflecting processing at two different ranges. Multiple gamma oscillations in visual cortex may provide a richer representation of external visual stimuli and could be used for developing brain–machine interfacing applications and screening tests for neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Combinatorial Effects of Alpha- and Gamma-Protocadherins on Neuronal Survival and Dendritic Self-Avoidance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2713?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2713?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) comprise 58 cadherin-related proteins encoded by three tandemly arrayed gene clusters, &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;-α, &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;-β, and &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;- (&lt;i&gt;Pcdha&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pcdhb&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Pcdhg&lt;/i&gt;, respectively). Pcdh isoforms from different clusters are combinatorially expressed in neurons. They form multimers that interact homophilically and mediate a variety of developmental processes, including neuronal survival, synaptic maintenance, axonal tiling, and dendritic self-avoidance. Most studies have analyzed clusters individually. Here, we assessed functional interactions between &lt;i&gt;Pcdha&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pcdhg&lt;/i&gt; clusters. To circumvent neonatal lethality associated with deletion of &lt;i&gt;Pcdhgs&lt;/i&gt;, we used Crispr-Cas9 genome editing in mice to combine a constitutive &lt;i&gt;Pcdha&lt;/i&gt; mutant allele with a conditional &lt;i&gt;Pcdhg&lt;/i&gt; allele. We analyzed roles of Pcdhas and Pcdhgs in the retina and cerebellum from mice (both sexes) lacking one or both clusters. In retina, Pcdhgs are essential for survival of inner retinal neurons and dendritic self-avoidance of starburst amacrine cells, whereas Pcdhas are dispensable for both processes. Deletion of both &lt;i&gt;Pcdha&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pcdhg&lt;/i&gt; clusters led to far more dramatic defects in survival and self-avoidance than &lt;i&gt;Pcdhg&lt;/i&gt; deletion alone. Comparisons of an allelic series of mutants support the conclusion that Pcdhas and Pcdhgs function together in a dose-dependent and cell-type-specific manner to provide a critical threshold of Pcdh activity. In the cerebellum, Pcdhas and Pcdhgs also cooperate to mediate self-avoidance of Purkinje cell dendrites, with modest but significant defects in either single mutant and dramatic defects in the double mutant. Together, our results demonstrate complex patterns of redundancy between Pcdh clusters and the importance of Pcdh cluster diversity in postnatal CNS development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The formation of neural circuits requires diversification and combinatorial actions of cell surface proteins. Prominent among them are the clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs), a family of ~60 neuronal recognition molecules. Pcdhs are encoded by three closely linked gene clusters called &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;-α, &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;-β, and &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;-. The Pcdhs mediate a variety of developmental processes, including neuronal survival, synaptic maintenance, and spatial patterning of axons and dendrites. Most studies to date have been limited to single clusters. Here, we used genome editing to assess interactions between &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;-α and &lt;i&gt;Pcdh&lt;/i&gt;- gene clusters. We examined two regions of the CNS, the retina and cerebellum and show that the 14 α-Pcdhs and 22 -Pcdhs act synergistically to mediate neuronal survival and dendrite patterning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Basolateral Amygdala Inputs to the Medial Entorhinal Cortex Selectively Modulate the Consolidation of Spatial and Contextual Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2698?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2698?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although evidence suggests that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and dorsal hippocampus (DH) work together to influence the consolidation of spatial/contextual learning, the circuit mechanism by which the BLA selectively modulates spatial/contextual memory consolidation is not clear. The medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) is a critical region in the hippocampus-based system for processing spatial information. As an efferent target of the BLA, the mEC is a candidate by which the BLA influences the consolidation of such learning. To address several questions regarding this issue, male Sprague Dawley rats received optogenetic manipulations of different BLA afferents immediately after training in different learning tasks. Optogenetic stimulation of the BLA–mEC pathway using ChR2(E123A) after spatial and cued-response Barnes maze training enhanced and impaired retention, respectively, whereas optical inhibition of the pathway using eNpHR3.0 produced trends in the opposite direction. Similar stimulation of the BLA-posterior dorsal striatum pathway had no effect. BLA–mEC stimulation also selectively enhanced retention for the contextual, but not foot shock, component of a modified contextual fear-conditioning procedure. In both sets of experiments, only stimulation using bursts of 8 Hz light pulses significantly enhanced retention, suggesting the importance of driving activity in this frequency range. An 8 Hz stimulation of the BLA–mEC pathway increased local field potential power in the same frequency range in the mEC and in the DH. Together, the present findings suggest that the BLA modulates the consolidation of spatial/contextual memory via projections to the mEC and that activity within the 8 Hz range is critical for this modulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanism by which the basolateral amygdala (BLA) influences the consolidation of spatial/contextual memory is unknown. Using an optogenetic approach with multiple behavioral procedures, we found that immediate posttraining 8 Hz stimulation of BLA projections to the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) enhanced retention for spatial/contextual memory, impaired retention for cued-response memory, and had no effect on foot shock learning for contextual fear conditioning. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed that 8 Hz stimulation of this pathway increased activity in the 8 Hz range in the mEC and in the dorsal hippocampus, a region critical for spatial memory consolidation. This suggests that coordinated BLA activity with downstream regions in the 8 Hz activity range immediately after training is important for consolidation of multiple memory forms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Protein Translation in the Nucleus Accumbens Is Dysregulated during Cocaine Withdrawal and Required for Expression of Incubation of Cocaine Craving</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2683?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2683?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to drug-associated cues can induce drug craving and relapse in abstinent addicts. Cue-induced craving that progressively intensifies (&quot;incubates&quot;) during withdrawal from cocaine has been observed in both rats and humans. Building on recent evidence that aberrant protein translation underlies incubation-related adaptations in the NAc, we used male rats to test the hypothesis that translation is dysregulated during cocaine withdrawal and/or when rats express incubated cocaine craving. We found that intra-NAc infusion of anisomycin, a general protein translation inhibitor, or rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, reduced the expression of incubated cocaine craving, consistent with previous results showing that inhibition of translation in slices normalized the adaptations that maintain incubation. We then examined signaling pathways involved in protein translation using NAc synaptoneurosomes prepared after &amp;gt;47 d of withdrawal from cocaine or saline self-administration, or after withdrawal plus a cue-induced seeking test. The most robust changes were observed following seeking tests. Most notably, we found that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) are dephosphorylated when cocaine rats undergo a cue-induced seeking test; both effects are consistent with increased translation during the test. Blocking eIF2α dephosphorylation and thereby restoring its inhibitory influence on translation, via intra-NAc injection of Sal003 just before the test, substantially reduced cocaine seeking. These results are consistent with dysregulation of protein translation in the NAc during cocaine withdrawal, enabling cocaine cues to elicit an aberrant increase in translation that is required for the expression of incubated cocaine craving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cue-induced cocaine craving progressively intensifies (incubates) during withdrawal in both humans and rats. This may contribute to persistent vulnerability to relapse. We previously demonstrated a role for protein translation in synaptic adaptations in the NAc closely linked to incubation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that translation is dysregulated during cocaine withdrawal, and this contributes to incubated craving. Analysis of signaling pathways regulating translation suggested that translation is enhanced when &quot;incubated&quot; rats undergo a cue-induced seeking test. Furthermore, intra-NAc infusions of drugs that inhibit protein translation through different mechanisms reduced expression of incubated cue-induced cocaine seeking. These results demonstrate that the expression of incubation depends on an acute increase in translation that may result from dysregulation of several pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Enhanced Operant Extinction and Prefrontal Excitability in a Mouse Model of Angelman Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2671?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/11/2671?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Angelman syndrome (AS), a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with intellectual disability, is caused by loss of maternal allele expression of &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; in neurons. Mouse models of AS faithfully recapitulate disease phenotypes across multiple domains, including behavior. Yet in AS, there has been only limited study of behaviors encoded by the prefrontal cortex, a region broadly involved in executive function and cognition. Because cognitive impairment is a core feature of AS, it is critical to develop behavioral readouts of prefrontal circuit function in AS mouse models. One such readout is behavioral extinction, which has been well described mechanistically and relies upon prefrontal circuits in rodents. Here we report exaggerated operant extinction in male AS model mice, concomitant with enhanced excitability in medial prefrontal neurons from male and female AS model mice. Abnormal behavior was specific to operant extinction, as two other prefrontally dependent tasks (cued fear extinction and visuospatial discrimination) were largely normal in AS model mice. Inducible deletion of &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; during adulthood was not sufficient to drive abnormal extinction, supporting the hypothesis that there is an early critical period for development of cognitive phenotypes in AS. This work represents the first formal experimental analysis of prefrontal circuit function in AS, and identifies operant extinction as a useful experimental paradigm for modeling cognitive aspects of AS in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prefrontal cortex encodes &quot;high-level&quot; cognitive processes. Thus, understanding prefrontal function is critical in neurodevelopmental disorders where cognitive impairment is highly penetrant. Angelman syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with speech and motor impairments, an outwardly happy demeanor, and intellectual disability. We describe a behavioral phenotype in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome and related abnormalities in prefrontal cortex function. We hypothesize that robust and reliable prefrontally encoded behavior may be used to model cognitive impairments in Angelman syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inferring directional connectivity from point process data of multiple
elements is desired in various scientific fields such as neuroscience,
geography, economics, etc. Here, we propose an inference procedure for this
goal based on the kinetic Ising model. The procedure is composed of two steps:
(1) determination of the time-bin size for transforming the point-process data
to discrete time binary data and (2) screening of relevant couplings from the
estimated networks. For these, we develop simple methods based on information
theory and computational statistics. Applications to data from artificial and
\textit{in vitro} neuronal networks show that the proposed procedure performs
fairly well when identifying relevant couplings, including the discrimination
of their signs, with low computational cost. These results highlight the
potential utility of the kinetic Ising model to analyze real interacting
systems with event occurrences.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04566</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04566</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) are neural oscillations from
the parietal and occipital regions of the brain that are evoked from flickering
visual stimuli. SSVEPs are robust signals measurable in the
electroencephalogram (EEG) and are commonly used in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs). However, methods for high-accuracy decoding of SSVEPs usually require
hand-crafted approaches that leverage domain-specific knowledge of the stimulus
signals, such as specific temporal frequencies in the visual stimuli and their
relative spatial arrangement. When this knowledge is unavailable, such as when
SSVEP signals are acquired asynchronously, such approaches tend to fail. In
this paper, we show how a compact convolutional neural network (Compact-CNN),
which only requires raw EEG signals for automatic feature extraction, can be
used to decode signals from a 12-class SSVEP dataset without the need for any
domain-specific knowledge or calibration data. We report across subject mean
accuracy of approximately 80% (chance being 8.3%) and show this is
substantially better than current state-of-the-art hand-crafted approaches
using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and Combined-CCA. Furthermore, we
analyze our Compact-CNN to examine the underlying feature representation,
discovering that the deep learner extracts additional phase and amplitude
related features associated with the structure of the dataset. We discuss how
our Compact-CNN shows promise for BCI applications that allow users to freely
gaze/attend to any stimulus at any time (e.g., asynchronous BCI) as well as
provides a method for analyzing SSVEP signals in a way that might augment our
understanding about the basic processing in the visual cortex.

	<description>Measurements of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), recorded using electroencephalography during different phases of movement, have been fundamental in understanding the neurophysiological changes related to motor control. SEP recordings have also been used to investigate adaptive plasticity changes in somatosensory processing related to active and observational motor learning tasks. Combining noninvasive brain stimulation with SEP recordings and intracranial SEP depth recordings, including recordings from deep brain stimulation electrodes, has been critical in identifying neural areas involved in specific temporal stages of somatosensory processing.</description>

	<description>The current-voltage (I-V) conversion characterizes the physiology of cellular microdomains and reflects cellular communication, excitability, and electrical transduction. Yet deriving such I-V laws remains a major challenge in most cellular microdomains due to their small sizes and the difficulty of accessing voltage with a high nanometer precision. We present here novel analytical relations derived for different numbers of ionic species inside a neuronal micro/nano-domains, such as dendritic spines. When a steady-state current is injected, we find a large deviation from the classical Ohm's law, showing that the spine neck resistance is insuficent to characterize electrical properties. For a constricted spine neck, modeled by a hyperboloid, we obtain a new I-V law that illustrates the consequences of narrow passages on electrical conduction. Finally, during a fast current transient, the local voltage is modulated by the distance between activated voltage-gated channels. To conclude, electro-diffusion laws can now be used to interpret voltage distribution in neuronal microdomains.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282434v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Due to the technical challenges of large-scale microscopy and analysis, to date only limited knowledge has been made available about axon morphometry (diameter, shape, myelin thickness, density), thereby limiting our understanding of neuronal microstructure and slowing down research on neurodegenerative pathologies. This study addresses this knowledge gap by establishing a state-of-the-art acquisition and analysis framework for mapping axon morphometry, and providing the first comprehensive mapping of axon morphometry in the human spinal cord. We dissected, fixed and stained a human spinal cord with osmium, and used a scanning electron microscope to image the entirety of 24 axial slices, covering C1 to L5 spinal levels. An automatic method based on deep learning was then used to segment each axon and myelin sheath which, producing maps of axon morphometry. These maps were then registered to a standard spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) template. Between 500,000 (lumbar) and 1 million (cervical) myelinated axons were segmented at each level of this human spinal cord. Morphometric features show a large disparity between tracts, but remarkable right-left symmetry. Results confirm the modality-based organization of the dorsal column in the human, as been observed in the rat. The generated axon morphometry template is publicly available at https://osf.io/8k7jr/ and could be used as a reference for quantitative MRI studies. The proposed framework for axon morphometry mapping could be extended to other parts of the central or peripheral nervous system.</description>

Here we report the neuro-reparative effects of myeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in a humanised murine model of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Mice received a transplant of fluorescently-tagged sex mis-matched bone marrow cells expressing wild-type frataxin and were assessed at monthly intervals using a range of behavioural motor performance tests. At six months post-transplant, mice were sacrificed for protein and histological analysis. In an attempt to augment numbers of bone marrow-derived cells integrating within the nervous system and improve therapeutic efficacy, a sub-group of transplanted mice also received monthly subcutaneous infusions of cytokines granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and stem cell factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Transplantation caused improvements in several indicators of motor coordination and locomotor activity. Elevations in frataxin levels and anti-oxidant defences were detected. Abrogation of disease pathology throughout the nervous system was apparent, together with extensive integration of bone marrow-derived cells in areas of nervous tissue injury that contributed genetic material to mature neurons, satellite-like cells and myelinating Schwann cells by processes including cell fusion. Elevations in circulating bone marrow-derived cell numbers were detected post-cytokine administration and were associated with increased frequencies of Purkinje cell fusion and bone marrow-derived dorsal root ganglion satellite-like cells. Further improvements in motor coordination and activity were evident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our data provide proof-of-concept of gene replacement therapy, via allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, that reverses neurological features of Friedreich's ataxia with the potential for rapid clinical translation.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurosurgery is an under-utilised treatment that can potentially cure drug-refractory epilepsy. Careful, multidisciplinary pre-surgical evaluation is vital for selecting patients and ensure optimal outcomes. Advances in neuroimaging have improved diagnosis and guide surgical intervention. Invasive electroencephalography allows the evaluation of complex patients who would otherwise not be candidates for neurosurgery. We review the current state of the assessment and selection of patients and consider established and novel surgical procedures, and associated outcome data. We aim to dispel myths that may inhibit physicians from referring and patients from considering neurosurgical intervention for drug-refractory focal epilepsies.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: De Novo Hotspot Variants in CYFIP2 Cause Early-Onset Epileptic Encephalopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25208</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25208</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: The cytoplasmic fragile X mental retardation 1 interacting proteins 2 (CYFIP2) is a component of the WAVE regulatory complex, which is involved in actin dynamics. An obvious association of &lt;em&gt;CYFIP2&lt;/em&gt; variants with human neurological disorders has never been reported. Here, we identified &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; hotspot &lt;em&gt;CYFIP2&lt;/em&gt; variants in neurodevelopmental disorders and explore the possible involvement of the CYFIP2 mutants in the WAVE signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We performed trio-based whole exome sequencing (WES) in 210 families and case-only WES in 489 individuals with epileptic encephalopathies. The functional effect of &lt;em&gt;CYFIP2&lt;/em&gt; variants on WAVE signaling was evaluated by computational structural analysis and in vitro transfection experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We identified three &lt;em&gt;de novo CYFIP2&lt;/em&gt; variants at the Arg87 residue in four unrelated individuals with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Structural analysis indicated that the Arg87 residue is buried at an interface between CYFIP2 and WAVE1, and the Arg87 variant may disrupt hydrogen bonding, leading to structural instability and aberrant activation of the WAVE regulatory complex. All mutant CYFIP2 showed comparatively weaker interactions to the VCA domain than wild type CYFIP2. Immunofluorescence revealed that ectopic speckled accumulation of actin and CYFIP2 was significantly increased in cells transfected with mutant CYFIP2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our findings suggest that &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; Arg87 variants in &lt;em&gt;CYFIP2&lt;/em&gt; have gain-of-function effects on the WAVE signaling pathway, and are associated with severe neurological disorders.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Seizures and disturbed brain potassium dynamics in the leukodystrophy megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25190-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss of function of the astrocyte-specific protein MLC1 leads to the childhood-onset leukodystrophy “megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts” (MLC). Studies on isolated cells show a role for MLC1 in astrocyte volume regulation and suggest that disturbed brain ion and water homeostasis is central to the disease. Excitability of neuronal networks is particularly sensitive to ion and water homeostasis. In line with this, reports of seizures and epilepsy in MLC patients exist. However, systematic assessment and mechanistic understanding of seizures in MLC are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25190-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed an MLC patient inventory to study occurrence of seizures in MLC. We used two distinct genetic mouse models of MLC to further study epileptiform activity and seizure threshold through wireless extracellular field potential recordings. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive electrode recordings in mouse brain slices were used to explore the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy in MLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25190-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early onset of seizures is common in MLC. Similarly, in MLC mice, we uncovered spontaneous epileptiform brain activity and a lowered threshold for induced seizures. At the cellular level, we found that although passive and active properties of individual pyramidal neurons are unchanged, extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics and neuronal network activity are abnormal in MLC mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25190-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disturbed astrocyte regulation of ion and water homeostasis in MLC causes hyperexcitability of neuronal networks and seizures. These findings suggest a role for defective astrocyte volume regulation in epilepsy. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25183-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed statistical parametric mapping of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 across 40 PPA patients (logopenic-PPA = 14, semantic-PPA = 13, and agrammatic-PPA = 13) compared to 80 cognitively normal, Pittsburgh compound B–negative controls, age and gender matched 2:1. Principal component analysis of regional [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 tau-PET standard uptake value ratio was performed to understand underlying patterns of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 uptake independent of clinical diagnosis. Penalized multinomial regression analyses were utilized to assess diagnostic utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25183-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logopenic-PPA showed striking uptake throughout neocortex, particularly temporoparietal, compared to controls, semantic-PPA, and agrammatic-PPA. Semantic-PPA and agrammatic-PPA showed milder patterns of focal [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 uptake. Semantic-PPA showed elevated uptake (left&amp;gt;right) in anteromedial temporal lobes, compared to controls and agrammatic-PPA. Agrammatic-PPA showed elevated uptake (left&amp;gt;right) throughout prefrontal white matter and in subcortical gray matter structures, compared to controls and semantic-PPA. The principal component analysis of regional [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 indicated two primary dimensions, a severity dimension that distinguished logopenic-PPA from agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA, and a frontal versus temporal contrast that distinguishes agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA cases. Diagnostic utility of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451was superior to MRI and at least equal to FDG-PET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25183-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451binding characteristics differ across the PPA variants and were excellent at distinguishing between the variants. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451binding characteristics were as good or better than other brain imaging modalities utilized in clinical practice, suggesting that [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 may have clinical diagnostic utility in PPA.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Activation of pial and dural macrophages and dendritic cells by cortical spreading depression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25169</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25169</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25169-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has long been implicated in migraine attacks with aura. The process by which CSD, a cortical event that occurs within the blood–brain barrier (BBB), results in nociceptor activation outside the BBB is likely mediated by multiple molecules and cells. The objective of this study was to determine whether CSD activates immune cells inside the BBB (pia), outside the BBB (dura), or in both, and if so, when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25169-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigating cellular events in the meninges shortly after CSD, we used &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; two-photon imaging to identify changes in macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) that reside in the pia, arachnoid, and dura and their anatomical relationship to TRPV1 axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25169-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that activated meningeal macrophages retract their processes and become circular, and that activated meningeal DCs stop migrating. We found that CSD activates pial macrophages instantaneously, pial, subarachnoid, and dural DCs 6-12 minutes later, and dural macrophages 20 minutes later. Dural macrophages and DCs can appear in close proximity to TRPV1-positive axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25169-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that activation of pial macrophages may be more relevant to cases where aura and migraine begin simultaneously, that activation of dural macrophages may be more relevant to cases where headache begins 20 to 30 minutes after aura, and that activation of dural macrophages may be mediated by activation of migratory DCs in the subarachnoid space and dura. The anatomical relationship between TRPV1-positive meningeal nociceptors, and dural macrophages and DCs supports a role for these immune cells in the modulation of head pain.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25167-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autosomal-dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) is a genetic focal epilepsy characterized by auditory symptoms. Two genes, &lt;em&gt;LGI1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;RELN&lt;/em&gt;, encoding secreted proteins, are implicated in the etiology of ADLTE, but half of the affected families remain genetically unsolved, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are yet to be clarified. We aimed to identify additional genes causing ADLTE to better understand the genetic basis and molecular pathway underlying this epileptic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25167-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cohort of Italian ADLTE families was examined by whole exome sequencing combined with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism-array linkage analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25167-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified two ADLTE-causing variants in the &lt;em&gt;MICAL-1&lt;/em&gt; gene: a p.Gly150Ser substitution occurring in the enzymatically active monooxygenase (MO) domain and a p.Ala1065fs frameshift indel in the C-terminal domain, which inhibits the oxidoreductase activity of the MO domain. Each variant segregated with ADLTE in a single family. Examination of candidate variants in additional genes excluded their implication in ADLTE. In cell-based assays, both variants significantly increased MICAL-1 oxidoreductase activity and induced cell contraction in COS7 cells, which likely resulted from deregulation of F-actin dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25167-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICAL-1 oxidoreductase activity induces disassembly of actin filaments, thereby regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in developing and adult neurons and in other cell types. This suggests that dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics is a likely mechanism by which &lt;em&gt;MICAL-1&lt;/em&gt; pathogenic variants lead to ADLTE.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25171-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) gene carriers can be identified before clinical diagnosis; however, statistical models for predicting when overt motor symptoms will manifest are too imprecise to be useful at the level of the individual. Perfecting this prediction is integral to the search for disease modifying therapies. This study aimed to identify an imaging marker capable of reliably predicting real-life clinical diagnosis in HD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25171-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Method&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multivariate machine learning approach was applied to resting-state and structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from 19 premanifest HD gene carriers (preHD, 8 of whom developed clinical disease in the 5 years postscanning) and 21 healthy controls. A classification model was developed using cross-group comparisons between preHD and controls, and within the preHD group in relation to “estimated” and “actual” proximity to disease onset. Imaging measures were modeled individually, and combined, and permutation modeling robustly tested classification accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25171-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classification performance for preHDs versus controls was greatest when all measures were combined. The resulting polymarker predicted converters with high accuracy, including those who were not expected to manifest in that time scale based on the currently adopted statistical models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25171-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that a holistic multivariate machine learning treatment of brain abnormalities in the premanifest phase can be used to accurately identify those patients within 5 years of developing motor features of HD, with implications for prognostication and preclinical trials.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Maturation Trajectories of Cortical Resting-State Networks Depend on the Mediating Frequency Band. (arXiv:1803.04364v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04364</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04364</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The functional significance of resting state networks and their abnormal
manifestations in psychiatric disorders are firmly established, as is the
importance of the cortical rhythms in mediating these networks. Resting state
networks are known to undergo substantial reorganization from childhood to
adulthood, but whether distinct cortical rhythms, which are generated by
separable neural mechanisms and are often manifested abnormally in psychiatric
conditions, mediate maturation differentially, remains unknown. Using
magnetoencephalography (MEG) to map frequency band specific maturation of
resting state networks from age 7 to 29 in 162 participants (31 independent),
we found significant changes with age in networks mediated by the beta
(13-30Hz) and gamma (31-80Hz) bands. More specifically, gamma band mediated
networks followed an expected asymptotic trajectory, but beta band mediated
networks followed a linear trajectory. Network integration increased with age
in gamma band mediated networks, while local segregation increased with age in
beta band mediated networks. Spatially, the hubs that changed in importance
with age in the beta band mediated networks had relatively little overlap with
those that showed the greatest changes in the gamma band mediated networks.
These findings are relevant for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of
cortical maturation, in both typical and atypical development.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Information of Epileptic Mechanism and its Systemic Change-points in a Zebrafish's Brain-wide Calcium Imaging Video Data. (arXiv:1803.04363v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04363</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The epileptic mechanism is postulated as that an animal's neurons gradually
diminish their inhibition function coupled with enhanced excitation when an
epileptic event is approaching. Calcium imaging technique is designed to
directly record brain-wide neurons activity in order to discover the underlying
epileptic mechanism. In this paper, using one brain-wide calcium imaging video
of Zebrafish, we compute dynamic pattern information of the epileptic
mechanism, and devise three graphical displays to show the visible functional
aspect of epileptic mechanism over five inter-ictal periods. The foundation of
our data-driven computations for such dynamic patterns relies on one universal
phenomenon discovered across 696 informative pixels. This universality is that
each pixel's progressive 5-percentile process oscillates in an irregular
fashion at first, but, after the middle point of inter-ictal period, the
oscillation is replaced by a steady increasing trend. Such dynamic patterns are
collectively transformed into a visible systemic change-point as an early
warning signal (EWS) of an incoming epileptic event. We conclude through the
graphic displays that pattern information extracted from the calcium imaging
video realistically reveals the Zebrafish's authentic epileptic mechanism.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04236</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04236</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, the parameter estimation problem for a multi-timescale
adaptive threshold (MAT) neuronal model is investigated. By manipulating the
system dynamics, which comprise of a non-resetting leaky integrator coupled
with an adaptive threshold, the threshold voltage can be obtained as a
realizable model that is linear in the unknown parameters. This linearly
parametrized realizable model is then utilized inside a prediction error based
framework to identify the threshold parameters with the purpose of predicting
single neuron precise firing times. The iterative linear least squares
estimation scheme is evaluated using both synthetic data obtained from an exact
model as well as experimental data obtained from in vitro rat somatosensory
cortical neurons. Results show the ability of this approach to fit the MAT
model to different types of fluctuating reference data. The performance of the
proposed approach is seen to be superior when comparing with existing
identification approaches used by the neuronal community.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04085</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A quantitative understanding of how sensory signals are transformed into
motor outputs places useful constraints on brain function and helps reveal the
brain's underlying computations. We investigate how the nematode C. elegans
responds to time-varying mechanosensory signals using a high-throughput
optogenetic assay and automated behavior quantification. In the prevailing
picture of the touch circuit, the animal's behavior is determined by which
neurons are stimulated and by the stimulus amplitude. In contrast, we find that
the nervous system is tuned to temporal properties of mechanosensory signals,
like its integral and derivative, that extend over many seconds. Mechanosensory
signals, even in the same neurons, can be tailored to elicit different
behavioral responses. Moreover, we find that the animal's response also depends
on its behavioral context. Most dramatically, the animal ignores all tested
mechanosensory stimuli during turns. Finally, we present a linear-nonlinear
model that predicts the animal's behavioral response to stimulus.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03940</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03940</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The current-voltage (I-V) conversion characterizes the physiology of cellular
microdomains and reflects cellular communication, excitability, and electrical
transduction. Yet deriving such I-V laws remains a major challenge in most
cellular microdomains due to their small sizes and the difficulty of accessing
voltage with a high nanometer precision. We present here novel analytical
relations derived for different numbers of ionic species inside a neuronal
micro/nano-domains, such as dendritic spines. When a steady-state current is
injected, we find a large deviation from the classical Ohm's law, showing that
the spine neck resistance is insuficent to characterize electrical properties.
For a constricted spine neck, modeled by a hyperboloid, we obtain a new I-V law
that illustrates the consequences of narrow passages on electrical conduction.
Finally, during a fast current transient, the local voltage is modulated by the
distance between activated voltage-gated channels. To conclude,
electro-diffusion laws can now be used to interpret voltage distribution in
neuronal microdomains.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: K-shell decomposition reveals hierarchical cortical organization of the human brain. (arXiv:1803.03742v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03742</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03742</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years numerous attempts to understand the human brain were
undertaken from a network point of view. A network framework takes into account
the relationships between the different parts of the system and enables to
examine how global and complex functions might emerge from network topology.
Previous work revealed that the human brain features 'small world'
characteristics and that cortical hubs tend to interconnect among themselves.
However, in order to fully understand the topological structure of hubs one
needs to go beyond the properties of a specific hub and examine the various
structural layers of the network. To address this topic further, we applied an
analysis known in statistical physics and network theory as k-shell
decomposition analysis. The analysis was applied on a human cortical network,
derived from MRI\DSI data of six participants. Such analysis enables us to
portray a detailed account of cortical connectivity focusing on different
neighborhoods of interconnected layers across the cortex. Our findings reveal
that the human cortex is highly connected and efficient, and unlike the
internet network contains no isolated nodes. The cortical network is comprised
of a nucleus alongside shells of increasing connectivity that formed one
connected giant component. All these components were further categorized into
three hierarchies in accordance with their connectivity profile, with each
hierarchy reflecting different functional roles. Such a model may explain an
efficient flow of information from the lowest hierarchy to the highest one,
with each step enabling increased data integration. At the top, the highest
hierarchy (the nucleus) serves as a global interconnected collective and
demonstrates high correlation with consciousness related regions, suggesting
that the nucleus might serve as a platform for consciousness to emerge.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is growing evidence regarding the importance of spike timing in neural
information processing, with even a small number of spikes carrying
information, but computational models lag significantly behind those for rate
coding. Experimental evidence on neuronal behavior is consistent with the
dynamical and state dependent behavior provided by recurrent connections. This
motivates the minimalistic abstraction investigated in this paper, aimed at
providing insight into information encoding in spike timing via recurrent
connections. We employ information-theoretic techniques for a simple reservoir
model which encodes input spatiotemporal patterns into a sparse neural code,
translating the polychronous groups introduced by Izhikevich into codewords on
which we can perform standard vector operations. We show that the distance
properties of the code are similar to those for (optimal) random codes. In
particular, the code meets benchmarks associated with both linear
classification and capacity, with the latter scaling exponentially with
reservoir size.

	<description>Current antiaging strategies focusing on druggable targets have met with relatively limited success to date. Replacement of cells, tissues, and organs could provide an alternative means for targeting age-induced damage and potentially eliminating some of it. However, before this is a viable option, numerous challenges need to be addressed. Most notably, whether the brain, which defines our self-identity, is amenable to replacement therapies is unclear. Here, we consider whether progressive cell replacement is a potential approach to reverse brain aging without grossly altering function.</description>

Chemokine receptors, a subclass of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), play essential roles in the human immune system, they are involved in cancer metastasis as well as in HIV-infection. A plethora of studies show that homo- and heterodimers or even higher order oligomers of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 modulate receptor function. In addition, membrane cholesterol affects chemokine receptor activity. However, structural information about homo- and heterodimers formed by chemokine receptors and their interplay with cholesterol is limited. Here, we report homo- and heterodimer configurations of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 at atomistic detail, as obtained from thousands of molecular dynamics simulations. The observed homodimerization patterns were similar for the closely related CC chemokine receptors, yet they differed significantly between the CC receptors and CXCR4. Despite their high sequence identity, cholesterol modulated the CC homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner. Chemokine receptor heterodimers display distinct dimerization patterns for CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2. Furthermore, associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 reveal an increased cholesterol-sensitivity as compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns. This work provides a first comprehensive structural overview over the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and the interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related GPCRs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Hs4EV4VzCNk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In order to access and filter content of life-science databases, full text search is a widely applied query interface. But its high flexibility and intuitiveness is paid for with potentially imprecise and incomplete query results. To reduce this drawback, query assistance systems suggest those combinations of keywords with the highest potential to match most of the relevant data records. Widespread approaches are syntactic query corrections that avoid misspelling and support expansion of words by suffixes and prefixes. Synonym expansion approaches apply thesauri, ontologies, and query logs. All need laborious curation and maintenance. Furthermore, access to query logs is in general restricted. Approaches that infer related queries by their query profile like research field, geographic location, co-authorship, affiliation etc. require user’s registration and its public accessibility that contradict privacy concerns. To overcome these drawbacks, we implemented LAILAPS-QSM, a machine learning approach that reconstruct possible linguistic contexts of a given keyword query. The context is referred from the text records that are stored in the databases that are going to be queried or extracted for a general purpose query suggestion from PubMed abstracts and UniProt data. The supplied tool suite enables the pre-processing of these text records and the further computation of customized distributed word vectors. The latter are used to suggest alternative keyword queries. An evaluated of the query suggestion quality was done for plant science use cases. Locally present experts enable a cost-efficient quality assessment in the categories trait, biological entity, taxonomy, affiliation, and metabolic function which has been performed using ontology term similarities. LAILAPS-QSM mean information content similarity for 15 representative queries is 0.70, whereas 34% have a score above 0.80. In comparison, the information content similarity for human expert made query suggestions is 0.90. The software is either available as tool set to build and train dedicated query suggestion services or as already trained general purpose RESTful web service. The service uses open interfaces to be seamless embeddable into database frontends. The JAVA implementation uses highly optimized data structures and streamlined code to provide fast and scalable response for web service calls. The source code of LAILAPS-QSM is available under GNU General Public License version 2 in Bitbucket GIT repository: https://bitbucket.org/ipk_bit_team/bioescorte-suggestion&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RJgEJ9jepIw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Relatively slow stochastic gene-state switching in the presence of positive feedback significantly broadens the region of bimodality through stabilizing the uninduced phenotypic state</title>

Within an isogenic population, even in the same extracellular environment, individual cells can exhibit various phenotypic states. The exact role of stochastic gene-state switching regulating the transition among these phenotypic states in a single cell is not fully understood, especially in the presence of positive feedback. Recent high-precision single-cell measurements showed that, at least in bacteria, switching in gene states is slow relative to the typical rates of active transcription and translation. Hence using the &lt;i&gt;lac&lt;/i&gt; operon as an archetype, in such a region of operon-state switching, we present a fluctuating-rate model for this classical gene regulation module, incorporating the more realistic operon-state switching mechanism that was recently elucidated. We found that the positive feedback mechanism induces bistability (referred to as deterministic bistability), and that the parameter range for its occurrence is significantly broadened by stochastic operon-state switching. We further show that in the absence of positive feedback, operon-state switching must be extremely slow to trigger bistability by itself. However, in the presence of positive feedback, which stabilizes the induced state, the relatively slow operon-state switching kinetics within the physiological region are sufficient to stabilize the uninduced state, together generating a broadened parameter region of bistability (referred to as stochastic bistability). We illustrate the opposite phenotype-transition rate dependence upon the operon-state switching rates in the two types of bistability, with the aid of a recently proposed rate formula for fluctuating-rate models. The rate formula also predicts a maximal transition rate in the intermediate region of operon-state switching, which is validated by numerical simulations in our model. Overall, our findings suggest a biological function of transcriptional “variations” among genetically identical cells, for the emergence of bistability and transition between phenotypic states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jYGTBzywAD4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Gap junction plasticity as a mechanism to regulate network-wide oscillations</title>

Cortical oscillations are thought to be involved in many cognitive functions and processes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate oscillations. One prominent but understudied mechanism is gap junction coupling. Gap junctions are ubiquitous in cortex between GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, recent experiments indicate their strength can be modified in an activity-dependent manner, similar to chemical synapses. We hypothesized that activity-dependent gap junction plasticity acts as a mechanism to regulate oscillations in the cortex. We developed a computational model of gap junction plasticity in a recurrent cortical network based on recent experimental findings. We showed that gap junction plasticity can serve as a homeostatic mechanism for oscillations by maintaining a tight balance between two network states: asynchronous irregular activity and synchronized oscillations. This homeostatic mechanism allows for robust communication between neuronal assemblies through two different mechanisms: transient oscillations and frequency modulation. This implies a direct functional role for gap junction plasticity in information transmission in cortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fShLgpxE30I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Particle-based simulations of polarity establishment reveal stochastic promotion of turing pattern formation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Pablo, Samuel A. Ramirez, Timothy C. Elston&lt;/p&gt;

Polarity establishment, the spontaneous generation of asymmetric molecular distributions, is a crucial component of many cellular functions. &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; (yeast) undergoes directed growth during budding and mating, and is an ideal model organism for studying polarization. In yeast and many other cell types, the Rho GTPase Cdc42 is the key molecular player in polarity establishment. During yeast polarization, multiple patches of Cdc42 initially form, then resolve into a single front. Because polarization relies on strong positive feedback, it is likely that the amplification of molecular-level fluctuations underlies the generation of multiple nascent patches. In the absence of spatial cues, these fluctuations may be key to driving polarization. Here we used particle-based simulations to investigate the role of stochastic effects in a Turing-type model of yeast polarity establishment. In the model, reactions take place either between two molecules on the membrane, or between a cytosolic and a membrane-bound molecule. Thus, we developed a computational platform that explicitly simulates molecules at and near the cell membrane, and implicitly handles molecules away from the membrane. To evaluate stochastic effects, we compared particle simulations to deterministic reaction-diffusion equation simulations. Defining macroscopic rate constants that are consistent with the microscopic parameters for this system is challenging, because diffusion occurs in two dimensions and particles exchange between the membrane and cytoplasm. We address this problem by empirically estimating macroscopic rate constants from appropriately designed particle-based simulations. Ultimately, we find that stochastic fluctuations speed polarity establishment and permit polarization in parameter regions predicted to be Turing stable. These effects can operate at Cdc42 abundances expected of yeast cells, and promote polarization on timescales consistent with experimental results. To our knowledge, our work represents the first particle-based simulations of a model for yeast polarization that is based on a Turing mechanism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_ccfBadz21A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The biological pacemaker approach is an alternative to cardiac electronic pacemakers. Its main objective is to create pacemaking activity from added or modified distribution of spontaneous cells in the myocardium. This paper aims to assess how automaticity strength of pacemaker cells (i.e. their ability to maintain robust spontaneous activity with fast rate and to drive neighboring quiescent cells) and structural linear anisotropy, combined with density and spatial distribution of pacemaker cells, may affect the macroscopic behavior of the biological pacemaker. A stochastic algorithm was used to randomly distribute pacemaker cells, with various densities and spatial distributions, in a semi-continuous mathematical model. Simulations of the model showed that stronger automaticity allows onset of spontaneous activity for lower densities and more homogeneous spatial distributions, displayed more central foci, less variability in cycle lengths and synchronization of electrical activation for similar spatial patterns, but more variability in those same variables for dissimilar spatial patterns. Compared their isotropic counterparts, &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; anisotropic monolayers had less central foci and displayed more variability in cycle lengths and synchronization of electrical activation for both similar and dissimilar spatial patterns. The present study established a link between microscopic structure and macroscopic behavior of the biological pacemaker, and may provide crucial information for optimized biological pacemaker therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LN7ks_yuF74&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Single-trial analyses have the potential to uncover meaningful brain dynamics that are obscured when averaging across trials. However, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede the use of single-trial analyses and decoding methods. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a single-trial approach to decode stimulus modality from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) high frequency activity. In order to classify the auditory versus visual presentation of words, we combine beamformer source reconstruction with the random forest classification method. To enable group level inference, the classification is embedded in an across-subjects framework. We show that single-trial gamma SNR allows for good classification performance (accuracy across subjects: 66.44%). This implies that the characteristics of high frequency activity have a high consistency across trials and subjects. The random forest classifier assigned informational value to activity in both auditory and visual cortex with high spatial specificity. Across time, gamma power was most informative during stimulus presentation. Among all frequency bands, the 75 Hz 95 Hz band was the most informative frequency band in visual as well as in auditory areas. Especially in visual areas, a broad range of gamma frequencies (55 Hz 125 Hz) contributed to the successful classification. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of single-trial approaches for decoding the stimulus modality across subjects from high frequency activity and describe the discriminative gamma activity in time, frequency, and space.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oy2L5cnKlBc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The ability to sense time and anticipate events is critical for survival. Learned responses that allow anticipation of the availability of food or water have been intensively studied. While anticipatory behaviors also occur prior to availability of regularly available rewards, there has been relatively little work on anticipation of drugs of abuse, specifically methamphetamine (MA). In the present study, we used a protocol that avoided possible CNS effects of stresses of handling or surgery by testing anticipation of MA availability in animals living in their home cages, with daily voluntary access to the drug at a fixed time of day. Anticipation was operationalized as the amount of wheel running prior to MA availability. Mice were divided into four groups given access to either nebulized MA or water, in early or late day. Animals with access to MA, but not water controls, showed anticipatory activity, with more anticipation in early compared to late day and significant interaction effects. Next, we explored the neural basis of the MA anticipation, using c-FOS expression, in animals euthanized at the usual time of nebulization access. In the dorsomedial hypothalamus and orbitofrontal cortex, the pattern of c-FOS expression paralleled that of anticipatory behavior, with significant main and interaction effects of treatment and time of day. The results for the lateral septum were significant for main effects and marginally significant for interaction effects. These studies suggest that anticipation of MA is associated with activation of brain regions important in circadian timing, emotional regulation and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; A primary function of the brain is to predict future events. Brain regions regulating anticipation of drugs have received little analysis. We studied methamphetamine anticipation in mice living in their home cage and having access to nebulized methamphetamine for 1hr daily via a tunnel to a nebulizing chamber. Mice spontaneously awakened from sleep ~2hr before methamphetamine availability and voluntarily entered the chamber when accessible. This protocol avoided the potential CNS effects associated with handling, injections and surgery. c-FOS expression before methamphetamine availability was observed in the dorsomedial hypothalamus, lateral septum, and orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting that anticipation of regularly scheduled methamphetamine is associated with activation of brain regions important in circadian timing, emotional regulation and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Hierarchically organized brains communicate through feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) pathways. In mammals, FF and FB are mediated by higher and lower frequencies during wakefulness. FB is preferentially impaired by general anesthetics in multiple mammalian species. This suggests FB serves critical functions in waking brains. The brain of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; (fruit fly) is also hierarchically organized, but the presence of FB in these brains is not established. Here, we studied FB in the fly brain, by simultaneously recording local field potentials (LFPs) from low-order peripheral structures and higher-order central structures. We analyzed the data using Granger causality (GC), the first application of this analysis technique to recordings from the insect brain. Our analysis revealed that low frequencies (0.1–5 Hz) mediated FB from the center to the periphery, while higher frequencies (10–45 Hz) mediated FF in the opposite direction. Further, isoflurane anesthesia preferentially reduced FB. Our results imply that the spectral characteristics of FF and FB may be a signature of hierarchically organized brains that is conserved from insects to mammals. We speculate that general anesthetics may induce unresponsiveness across species by targeting the mechanisms that support FB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Measuring and Validating the Levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Human Serum</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secreted by neurons is a significant component of synaptic plasticity. In humans, it is also present in blood platelets where it accumulates following its biosynthesis in megakaryocytes. BDNF levels are thus readily detectable in human serum and it has been abundantly speculated that they may somehow serve as an indicator of brain function. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the range of BDNF levels that can be considered normal, how stable these values are over time and even whether BDNF levels can be reliably measured in serum. Using monoclonal antibodies and a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), this study reports on BDNF levels in the serum of 259 volunteers with a mean value of 32.69 ± 8.33 ng/ml (SD). The mean value for the same cohort after 12 months was not significantly different (N = 226, 32.97 ± 8.36 ng/ml SD, p = 0.19). Power analysis of these values indicates that relatively large cohorts are necessary to identify significant differences, requiring a group size of 60 to detect a 20% change. The levels determined by ELISA could be validated by Western blot analyses using a BDNF monoclonal antibody. Whilst no association was observed with gender, a weak, &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt; correlation was found with age. The overall conclusions are that BDNF levels can be reliably measured in human serum, that these levels are quite stable over one year, and that comparisons between two populations may only be meaningful if cohorts of sufficient sizes are assembled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The presence of BDNF in human blood has generated considerable interest as illustrated by the very large number of publications associating BDNF levels with various conditions affecting brain function, including depression and neurodegeneration. Yet a range of technical issues, together with a lack of plausible mechanisms explaining this association, raise questions as to the meaning and value of such measurements. This contribution deals with the feasibility of reliably measuring BDNF levels in human serum and gives indications of the size of cohorts to be recruited for meaningful differences to be observed between populations of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A model of reward-modulated motor learning with parallelcortical and basal ganglia pathways. (arXiv:1803.03304v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03304</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03304</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many recent studies of the motor system are divided into two distinct
approaches: Those that investigate how motor responses are encoded in cortical
neurons' firing rate dynamics and those that study the learning rules by which
mammals and songbirds develop reliable motor responses. Computationally, the
first approach is encapsulated by reservoir computing models, which can learn
intricate motor tasks and produce internal dynamics strikingly similar to those
of motor cortical neurons, but rely on biologically unrealistic learning rules.
The more realistic learning rules developed by the second approach are often
derived for simplified, discrete tasks in contrast to the intricate dynamics
that characterize real motor responses. We bridge these two approaches to
develop a biologically realistic learning rule for reservoir computing. Our
algorithm learns simulated motor tasks on which previous reservoir computing
algorithms fail, and reproduces experimental findings including those that
relate motor learning to Parkinson's disease and its treatment.

This study reports the range of orthostatic heart rate (HR) changes in patients with autonomic failure caused by neurodegenerative synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25170-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients evaluated at sites of the U.S. Autonomic Consortium (NCT01799915) underwent standardized autonomic function tests and full neurological evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Of these, 378 had impaired sympathetic activation (ie, neurogenic OH) and based on their neurological examination were diagnosed with Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, pure autonomic failure, or multiple system atrophy. The remaining 24 patients had preserved sympathetic activation and their OH was classified as nonneurogenic, due to volume depletion, anemia, or polypharmacy. Patients with neurogenic OH had twice the fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP; −44 ± 25 vs −21 ± 14 mmHg [mean ± standard deviation], &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) but only one-third of the increase in HR of those with nonneurogenic OH (8 ± 8 vs 25 ± 11 beats per minute [bpm], &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). A ΔHR/ΔSBP ratio of 0.492 bpm/mmHg had excellent sensitivity (91.3%) and specificity (88.4%) to distinguish between patients with neurogenic from nonneurogenic OH (area under the curve = 0.96, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Within patients with neurogenic OH, HR increased more in those with multiple system atrophy (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0003), but there was considerable overlap with patients with Lewy body disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25170-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blunted HR increase during hypotension suggests a neurogenic cause. A ΔHR/ΔSBP ratio &amp;lt; 0.5 bpm/mmHg is diagnostic of neurogenic OH. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25168-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nerve excitability test in SMA patients showed increased inward rectification in the current-threshold relationship and increased overshoot after hyperpolarizing threshold electrotonus, which indicates increased hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current; these findings correlated with disease severity. Increased inward rectification in the current-threshold relationship was reproducible in a mouse model of mild SMA, and the abnormality preceded the decline of compound motor action potential amplitudes. Furthermore, quantitative PCR of spinal cord tissues and western blotting of the spinal cord and sciatic nerves showed increased HCN1 and HCN2 expression in SMA mice, and voltage-clamp recording in dissociated spinal motor neurons from SMA mice also showed increased HCN current density. Treatment with ZD7288, an HCN channel blocker, also reduced early mortality, improved motor function, and restored neuromuscular junction architecture in a mouse model of severe SMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dysregulation of NEUROG2 plays a key role in focal cortical dysplasia</title>

	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25187</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25187-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are an important cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. In this work, we aimed to investigate whether abnormal gene regulation, mediated by microRNA, could be involved in FCD type II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25187-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used total RNA from the brain tissue of 16 patients with FCD type II and 28 controls. MicroRNA expression was initially assessed by microarray. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, luciferase reporter assays, and deep sequencing for genes in the mTOR pathway were performed to validate and further explore our initial study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25187-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;hsa-let-7f (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.039), hsa-miR-31 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0078), and hsa-miR34a (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.021) were downregulated in FCD type II, whereas a transcription factor involved in neuronal and glial fate specification, &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), was upregulated. We also found that the &lt;em&gt;RND2&lt;/em&gt; gene, a &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2-&lt;/em&gt;target, is upregulated (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In vitro experiments showed that hsa-miR-34a downregulates &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; by binding to its 5′-untranslated region. Moreover, we observed strong nuclear expression of &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; in balloon cells and dysmorphic neurons and found that 28.5% of our patients presented brain somatic mutations in genes of the mTOR pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25187-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest a new molecular mechanism, in which &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; has a pivotal and central role in the pathogenesis of FCD type II. In this way, we found that the downregulation of hsa-miR-34a leads to upregulation of &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt;, and consequently to overexpression of the &lt;em&gt;RND2&lt;/em&gt; gene. These findings indicate that a faulty coupling in neuronal differentiation and migration mechanisms may explain the presence of aberrant cells and complete dyslamination in FCD type II.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25178-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that disordered breathing is critically involved in Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). To that end, evaluating structures that are activated by seizures and can activate brain regions that produce cardiorespiratory changes can further our understanding of the pathophysiology of SUDEP. Past preclinical studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the human amygdala induces apnea, suggesting a role for the amygdala in controlling respiration. In this study, we aimed to both confirm these findings in a larger group of patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and also further explore the anatomical and cognitive properties of this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25178-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven surgical TLE patients had depth electrodes implanted in the amygdala that were used to deliver electrical stimulation during functional mapping preceding resection. Real-time respiratory monitoring was performed in each patient to confirm apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25178-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data confirm that amygdala stimulation reliably induces apnea (occurring in all 7 patients) and further suggest that apnea can be overcome by instructing the patient to inhale, and can be prevented entirely by breathing through the mouth before electrical stimulation. Finally, stimulation-induced apnea occurred only when stimulating the medial-most amygdalar contacts located in the central nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25178-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings confirm a functional connection between the amygdala and respiratory control in humans. Moreover, they suggest specific amygdalar nuclei may be critical in mediating this effect and that attentional state is critical to apnea mediated by amygdala activation—perhaps alluding to future development of strategies for the prevention of SUDEP.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The importance of geometry in the corneal micropocket angiogenesis assay</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006049</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by James A. Grogan, Anthony J. Connor, Joe M. Pitt-Francis, Philip K. Maini, Helen M. Byrne&lt;/p&gt;

The corneal micropocket angiogenesis assay is an experimental protocol for studying vessel network formation, or neovascularization, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The assay is attractive due to the ease with which the developing vessel network can be observed in the same animal over time. Measurements from the assay have been used in combination with mathematical modeling to gain insights into the mechanisms of angiogenesis. While previous modeling studies have adopted planar domains to represent the assay, the hemispherical shape of the cornea and asymmetric positioning of the angiogenic source can be seen to affect vascular patterning in experimental images. As such, we aim to better understand: i) how the geometry of the assay influences vessel network formation and ii) how to relate observations from planar domains to those in the hemispherical cornea. To do so, we develop a three-dimensional, off-lattice mathematical model of neovascularization in the cornea, using a spatially resolved representation of the assay for the first time. Relative to the detailed model, we predict that the adoption of planar geometries has a noticeable impact on vascular patterning, leading to increased vessel ‘merging’, or anastomosis, in particular when circular geometries are adopted. Significant differences in the dynamics of diffusible aniogenesis simulators are also predicted between different domains. In terms of comparing predictions across domains, the ‘distance of the vascular front to the limbus’ metric is found to have low sensitivity to domain choice, while metrics such as densities of tip cells and vessels and ‘vascularized fraction’ are sensitive to domain choice. Given the widespread adoption and attractive simplicity of planar tissue domains, both &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, the differences identified in the present study should prove useful in relating the results of previous and future theoretical studies of neovascularization to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; observations in the cornea.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wlGrLwmrFRo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Ecological and laboratory studies have demonstrated that temperature modulates West Nile virus (WNV) transmission dynamics and spillover infection to humans. Here we explore whether inclusion of temperature forcing in a model depicting WNV transmission improves WNV forecast accuracy relative to a baseline model depicting WNV transmission without temperature forcing. Both models are optimized using a data assimilation method and two observed data streams: mosquito infection rates and reported human WNV cases. Each coupled model-inference framework is then used to generate retrospective ensemble forecasts of WNV for 110 outbreak years from among 12 geographically diverse United States counties. The temperature-forced model improves forecast accuracy for much of the outbreak season. From the end of July until the beginning of October, a timespan during which 70% of human cases are reported, the temperature-forced model generated forecasts of the total number of human cases over the next 3 weeks, total number of human cases over the season, the week with the highest percentage of infectious mosquitoes, and the peak percentage of infectious mosquitoes that on average increased absolute forecast accuracy 5%, 10%, 12%, and 6%, respectively, over the non-temperature forced baseline model. These results indicate that use of temperature forcing improves WNV forecast accuracy and provide further evidence that temperature influences rates of WNV transmission. The findings provide a foundation for implementation of a statistically rigorous system for real-time forecast of seasonal WNV outbreaks and their use as a quantitative decision support tool for public health officials and mosquito control programs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9oxjUwJGPVY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The use of 3C-based methods has revealed the importance of the 3D organization of the chromatin for key aspects of genome biology. However, the different caveats of the variants of 3C techniques have limited their scope and the range of scientific fields that could benefit from these approaches. To address these limitations, we present 4Cin, a method to generate 3D models and derive virtual Hi-C (vHi-C) heat maps of genomic loci based on 4C-seq or any kind of 4C-seq-like data, such as those derived from NG Capture-C. 3D genome organization is determined by integrative consideration of the spatial distances derived from as few as four 4C-seq experiments. The 3D models obtained from 4C-seq data, together with their associated vHi-C maps, allow the inference of all chromosomal contacts within a given genomic region, facilitating the identification of Topological Associating Domains (TAD) boundaries. Thus, 4Cin offers a much cheaper, accessible and versatile alternative to other available techniques while providing a comprehensive 3D topological profiling. By studying TAD modifications in genomic structural variants associated to disease phenotypes and performing cross-species evolutionary comparisons of 3D chromatin structures in a quantitative manner, we demonstrate the broad potential and novel range of applications of our method.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0r_nU8GIe4g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Neuronal gain modulability is determined by dendritic morphology: A computational optogenetic study</title>

The mechanisms by which the gain of the neuronal input-output function may be modulated have been the subject of much investigation. However, little is known of the role of dendrites in neuronal gain control. New optogenetic experimental paradigms based on spatial profiles or patterns of light stimulation offer the prospect of elucidating many aspects of single cell function, including the role of dendrites in gain control. We thus developed a model to investigate how competing excitatory and inhibitory input within the dendritic arbor alters neuronal gain, incorporating kinetic models of opsins into our modeling to ensure it is experimentally testable. To investigate how different topologies of the neuronal dendritic tree affect the neuron’s input-output characteristics we generate branching geometries which replicate morphological features of most common neurons, but keep the number of branches and overall area of dendrites approximately constant. We found a relationship between a neuron’s gain modulability and its dendritic morphology, with neurons with bipolar dendrites with a moderate degree of branching being most receptive to control of the gain of their input-output relationship. The theory was then tested and confirmed on two examples of realistic neurons: 1) layer V pyramidal cells—confirming their role in neural circuits as a regulator of the gain in the circuit in addition to acting as the primary excitatory neurons, and 2) stellate cells. In addition to providing testable predictions and a novel application of dual-opsins, our model suggests that innervation of all dendritic subdomains is required for full gain modulation, revealing the importance of dendritic targeting in the generation of neuronal gain control and the functions that it subserves. Finally, our study also demonstrates that neurophysiological investigations which use direct current injection into the soma and bypass the dendrites may miss some important neuronal functions, such as gain modulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1YQd4XrcVE4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: ChromoTrace: Computational reconstruction of 3D chromosome configurations for super-resolution microscopy</title>

The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair. Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression. Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside cells. Combined with highly specific, sensitive and multiplexed fluorescence labeling of DNA sequences this opens up the possibility of mapping the 3D path of the genome sequence in situ. Here we develop computational methodologies to reconstruct the sequence configuration of all human chromosomes in the nucleus from a super-resolution image of a set of fluorescent in situ probes hybridized to the genome in a cell. To test our approach, we develop a method for the simulation of DNA in an idealized human nucleus. Our reconstruction method, ChromoTrace, uses suffix trees to assign a known linear ordering of in situ probes on the genome to an unknown set of 3D in-situ probe positions in the nucleus from super-resolved images using the known genomic probe spacing as a set of physical distance constraints between probes. We find that ChromoTrace can assign the 3D positions of the majority of loci with high accuracy and reasonable sensitivity to specific genome sequences. By simulating appropriate spatial resolution, label multiplexing and noise scenarios we assess our algorithms performance. Our study shows that it is feasible to achieve genome-wide reconstruction of the 3D DNA path based on super-resolution microscopy images.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VJh9lTsZKRE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Susceptibility to Oxidative Stress Is Determined by Genetic Background in Neuronal Cell Cultures</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to a deleterious and multifactorial secondary inflammatory response in the brain. Oxidative stress from the inflammation likely contributes to the brain damage although it is unclear to which extent. A largely unexplored approach is to consider phenotypic regulation of oxidative stress levels. Genetic polymorphism influences inflammation in the central nervous system and it is possible that the antioxidative response differs between phenotypes and affects the severity of the secondary injury. We therefore compared the antioxidative response in inbred rat strains Dark Agouti (DA) to Piebald Viral Glaxo (PVG). DA has high susceptibility to inflammatory challenges and PVG is protected. Primary neuronal cell cultures were exposed to peroxynitrite (ONOO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Our findings demonstrated a phenotypic control of the neuronal antioxidative response, specific to manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). DA neurons had increased levels of MnSOD, equal levels of peroxiredoxin 5, decreased oxidative stress markers 3-Nitrotyrosine and 4-HNE and decreased neuronal death detected by lactate dehydrogenase release after 24h, and higher oxidative stress levels by CellROX than PVG after 2h. It is possible that DA neurons had a phenotypic adaptation to a fiercer inflammatory environment. Peroxynitrite was confirmed as the most powerful oxidative damage mediator, while 4-HNE caused few oxidative effects. iNOS was not induced, suggesting that inflammatory, while not oxidative stimulation was required. These findings indicate that phenotypic antioxidative regulation affects the secondary inflammation, which should be considered in future individualized treatments and when evaluating antioxidative pharmacological interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Neurotrauma leads to inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain. The outcome differs between individuals and it is largely unknown what causes this diversity. It is possible that the brain phenotype is linked to oxidative stress levels, and that some individuals acquire less oxidative stress than others. We therefore tested the oxidative stress reaction patterns in rat neurons from two strains with different susceptibility to inflammation. We found that the phenotypes have different regulation of antioxidative enzymes and oxidative stress. While further studies are needed to corroborate the findings &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, it is a proof of concept of genetic regulation of direct oxidative stress, which may impact outcome after TBI and interact with future antioxidative treatment trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Strengthening Relationships between Neural Ideals and Receptive Fields. (arXiv:1803.03204v1 [math.AC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural codes are collections of binary vectors that represent the firing
patterns of neurons. The information given by a neural code $C$ can be
represented by its neural ideal $J_C$. In turn, the polynomials in $J_C$ can be
used to determine the relationships among the receptive fields of the neurons.
In a paper by Curto et al., three such relationships, known as the Type 1-3
relations, were linked to the neural ideal by three if-and-only-if statements.
Later, Garcia et al. discovered the Type 4-6 relations. These new relations
differed from the first three in that they were related to $J_C$ by one-way
implications. In this paper, we first show that the converses of these new
implications are false at the level of both the neural ideal $J_C$ and the
larger ideal $I(C)$ of a code. We then present modified statements of these
relations that, like the first three, can be related by if-and-only-if
statements to both $J_C$ and $I(C)$. Using the modified relations, we uncover a
new relationship involving $J_C$, $I(C)$, and the Type 1-6 relations.

	<description>Neurons are dynamic cells that respond and adapt to stimuli throughout their long postmitotic lives. The structural and functional plasticity of neurons requires the regulated transcription of new gene products, and dysregulation of transcription in either the developing or adult brain impairs cognition. We discuss how mechanisms of chromatin regulation help to orchestrate the transcriptional programs that underlie the maturation of developing neurons and the plasticity of adult neurons. We review how chromatin regulation acts locally to modulate the expression of specific genes and more broadly to coordinate gene expression programs during transitions between cellular states.</description>

	<description>Post-translational modification of substrate proteins by SUMO conjugation regulates a diverse array of cellular processes. While predominantly a nuclear protein modification, there is a growing appreciation that SUMOylation of proteins outside the nucleus plays direct roles in controlling synaptic transmission, neuronal excitability, and adaptive responses to cell stress. Furthermore, alterations in protein SUMOylation are observed in a wide range of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, and several extranuclear disease-associated proteins have been shown to be directly SUMOylated.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Stoichiometric balance of protein copy numbers is measurable and functionally significant in a protein-protein interaction network for yeast endocytosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006022</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by David O. Holland, Margaret E. Johnson&lt;/p&gt;

Stoichiometric balance, or dosage balance, implies that proteins that are subunits of obligate complexes (e.g. the ribosome) should have copy numbers expressed to match their stoichiometry in that complex. Establishing balance (or imbalance) is an important tool for inferring subunit function and assembly bottlenecks. We show here that these correlations in protein copy numbers can extend beyond complex subunits to larger protein-protein interactions networks (PPIN) involving a range of reversible binding interactions. We develop a simple method for quantifying balance in any interface-resolved PPINs based on network structure and experimentally observed protein copy numbers. By analyzing such a network for the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) system in yeast, we found that the real protein copy numbers were significantly more balanced in relation to their binding partners compared to randomly sampled sets of yeast copy numbers. The observed balance is not perfect, highlighting both under and overexpressed proteins. We evaluate the potential cost and benefits of imbalance using two criteria. First, a potential cost to imbalance is that ‘leftover’ proteins without remaining functional partners are free to misinteract. We systematically quantify how this misinteraction cost is most dangerous for strong-binding protein interactions and for network topologies observed in biological PPINs. Second, a more direct consequence of imbalance is that the formation of specific functional complexes depends on relative copy numbers. We therefore construct simple kinetic models of two sub-networks in the CME network to assess multi-protein assembly of the ARP2/3 complex and a minimal, nine-protein clathrin-coated vesicle forming module. We find that the observed, imperfectly balanced copy numbers are less effective than balanced copy numbers in producing fast and complete multi-protein assemblies. However, we speculate that strategic imbalance in the vesicle forming module allows cells to tune where endocytosis occurs, providing sensitive control over cargo uptake via clathrin-coated vesicles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zan2QIqtr3g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Collateral Projections Innervate the Mammillary Bodies and Retrosplenial Cortex: A New Category of Hippocampal Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0383-17.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To understand the hippocampus, it is necessary to understand the subiculum. Unlike other hippocampal subfields, the subiculum projects to almost all distal hippocampal targets, highlighting its critical importance for external networks. The present studies, in male rats and mice, reveal a new category of dorsal subiculum neurons that innervate both the mammillary bodies (MBs) and the retrosplenial cortex (RSP). These bifurcating neurons comprise almost half of the hippocampal cells that project to RSP. The termination of these numerous collateral projections was visualized within the medial mammillary nucleus and the granular RSP (area 29). These collateral projections included subiculum efferents that cross to the contralateral MBs. Within the granular RSP, the collateral projections form a particularly dense plexus in deep Layer II and Layer III. This retrosplenial termination site colocalized with markers for VGluT2 and neurotensin. While efferents from the hippocampal CA fields standardly collateralize, subiculum projections often have only one target site. Consequently, the many collateral projections involving the RSP and the MBs present a relatively unusual pattern for the subiculum, which presumably relates to how both targets have complementary roles in spatial processing. Furthermore, along with the anterior thalamic nuclei, the MBs and RSP are key members of a memory circuit, which is usually described as both starting and finishing in the hippocampus. The present findings reveal how the hippocampus simultaneously engages different parts of this circuit, so forcing an important revision of this network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Losing Control in Social Situations: How the Presence of Others Affects Neural Processes Related to Sense of Agency</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social contexts substantially influence individual behavior, but little is known about how they affect cognitive processes related to voluntary action. Previously, it has been shown that social context reduces participants’ sense of agency over the outcomes of their actions and outcome monitoring. In this fMRI study on human volunteers, we investigated the neural mechanisms by which social context alters sense of agency. Participants made costly actions to stop inflating a balloon before it burst. On &quot;social&quot; trials, another player could act in their stead, but we analyzed only trials in which the other player remained passive. We hypothesized that mentalizing processes during social trials would affect decision-making fluency and lead to a decreased sense of agency. In line with this hypothesis, we found increased activity in the bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), precuneus, and middle frontal gyrus during social trials compared with nonsocial trials. Activity in the precuneus was, in turn, negatively related to sense of agency at a single-trial level. We further found a double dissociation between TPJ and angular gyrus (AG): activity in the left AG was not sensitive to social context but was negatively related to sense of agency. In contrast, activity in the TPJ was modulated by social context but was not sensitive to sense of agency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Reliability-Weighted Integration of Audiovisual Signals Can Be Modulated by Top-down Attention</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, it is well established that human observers integrate signals near-optimally weighted in proportion to their reliabilities as predicted by maximum likelihood estimation. Yet, despite abundant behavioral evidence, it is unclear how the human brain accomplishes this feat. In a spatial ventriloquist paradigm, participants were presented with auditory, visual, and audiovisual signals and reported the location of the auditory or the visual signal. Combining psychophysics, multivariate functional MRI (fMRI) decoding, and models of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we characterized the computational operations underlying audiovisual integration at distinct cortical levels. We estimated observers’ behavioral weights by fitting psychometric functions to participants’ localization responses. Likewise, we estimated the neural weights by fitting neurometric functions to spatial locations decoded from regional fMRI activation patterns. Our results demonstrate that low-level auditory and visual areas encode predominantly the spatial location of the signal component of a region’s preferred auditory (or visual) modality. By contrast, intraparietal sulcus forms spatial representations by integrating auditory and visual signals weighted by their reliabilities. Critically, the neural and behavioral weights and the variance of the spatial representations depended not only on the sensory reliabilities as predicted by the MLE model but also on participants’ modality-specific attention and report (i.e., visual vs. auditory). These results suggest that audiovisual integration is not exclusively determined by bottom-up sensory reliabilities. Instead, modality-specific attention and report can flexibly modulate how intraparietal sulcus integrates sensory signals into spatial representations to guide behavioral responses (e.g., localization and orienting).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Dopamine D2 Receptors in Dopaminergic Neurons Modulate Performance in a Reversal Learning Task in Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies in animal models and human subjects have each revealed that relatively low striatal dopamine D2-like receptor binding potential is associated with poor impulse control and with vulnerability for addiction-related behaviors. These studies cannot, however, disambiguate the roles for various pools of D2 receptors found in the striatum (e.g., those expressed on medium spiny striato-pallidal neurons vs on dopamine-releasing nerve terminals) in these behavioral outcomes. To clarify the role of the latter pool, namely, D2 autoreceptors, we studied mice carrying a conditional DRD2 gene, with or without Cre-recombinase expressed under the transcriptional control of the dopamine transporter gene locus (autoDrd2-KO, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 19 and controls, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21). These mice were tested for locomotor response to cocaine, and spatial reversal learning was assessed in operant conditioning chambers. As predicted, compared to control mice, autoDrd2-KO animals demonstrated heightened sensitivity to the locomotor stimulating effect of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), confirming previous research using a similar genetic model. In the spatial reversal learning task, autoDrd2-KO mice were slower to reach a learning criterion and had difficulty sustaining a prolonged nose poke response, measurements conceptually related to impaired response inhibition. Rate of learning of the initial discrimination and latencies to collect rewards, to initiate trials and to produce a response were unaffected by genetic deletion of D2 autoreceptors, discarding possible motor and motivational factors. Together, these findings confirm the role of D2 autoreceptors in reversal learning and suggest a broader involvement in behavioral inhibition mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sulcal Polymorphisms of the IFC and ACC Contribute to Inhibitory Control Variability in Children and Adults</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory control (IC) is a core executive function that enables humans to resist habits, temptations, or distractions. IC efficiency in childhood is a strong predictor of academic and professional success later in life. Based on analysis of the sulcal pattern, a qualitative feature of cortex anatomy determined during fetal life and stable during development, we searched for evidence that interindividual differences in IC partly trace back to prenatal processes. Using anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we analyzed the sulcal pattern of two key regions of the IC neural network, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the inferior frontal cortex (IFC), which limits the inferior frontal gyrus. We found that the sulcal pattern asymmetry of both the ACC and IFC contributes to IC (Stroop score) in children and adults: participants with asymmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns had better IC efficiency than participants with symmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns. Such additive effects of IFC and ACC sulcal patterns on IC efficiency suggest that distinct early neurodevelopmental mechanisms targeting different brain regions likely contribute to IC efficiency. This view shares some analogies with the &quot;common variant–small effect&quot; model in genetics, which states that frequent genetic polymorphisms have small effects but collectively account for a large portion of the variance. Similarly, each sulcal polymorphism has a small but additive effect: IFC and ACC sulcal patterns, respectively, explained 3% and 14% of the variance of the Stroop interference scores.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Hu and Bean show that the proximal axon of pyramidal neurons has a negative resting potential relative to the soma. The difference arises from axonally localized Kv7 channels, whose resting activation depends on depolarizing somatic HCN current flowing to the axon.</description>

	<description>Rousseaux, Tschumperlin, Lu, and colleagues show that formation of the ATXN1-CIC complex is critical for polyQ-expanded ATXN1-mediated toxicity. They find that this complex mediates its effects through a gain-of-function mechanism in the cerebellum of SCA1 mice and SCA1 patient-derived neurons.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Inhibition of a Descending Prefrontal Circuit Prevents Ketamine-Induced Stress Resilience in Females</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Stress is a potent etiological factor in the onset of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, significant efforts have been made to identify factors that produce resilience to the outcomes of a later stressor, in hopes of preventing untoward clinical outcomes. The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has recently emerged as a prophylactic capable of preventing neurochemical and behavioral outcomes of a future stressor. Despite promising results of preclinical studies performed in male rats, the effects of proactive ketamine in female rats remains unknown. This is alarming given that stress-related disorders affect females at nearly twice the rate of males. Here we explore the prophylactic effects of ketamine on stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and the neural circuit-level processes that mediate these effects in female rats. Ketamine given one week prior to an uncontrollable stressor (inescapable tailshock; IS) reduced typical stress-induced activation of the serotonergic (5-HT) dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and eliminated DRN-dependent juvenile social exploration (JSE) deficits 24 h after the stressor. Proactive ketamine altered prelimbic cortex (PL) neural ensembles so that a later experience with IS now activated these cells, which it ordinarily would not. Ketamine acutely activated a PL to DRN (PL-DRN) circuit and inhibition of this circuit with Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) at the time of IS one week later prevented stress prophylaxis, suggesting that persistent changes in PL-DRN circuit activity are responsible, at least in part, for mediating long-term effects associated with ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: miR-214-3p Targets β-Catenin to Regulate Depressive-like Behaviors Induced by Chronic Social Defeat Stress in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy047</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;β-Catenin has been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD), which is associated with synaptic plasticity and dendritic arborization. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs containing about 22 nucleotides and involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological process, but their roles in MDD remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the expression and function of miRNAs in the mouse model of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). The regulation of β-catenin by selected miRNA was validated by silico prediction, target gene luciferase reporter assay, and transfection experiment in neurons. We demonstrated that the levels of miR-214-3p, which targets β-catenin transcripts were significantly increased in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of CSDS mice. Antagomir-214-3p, a neutralizing inhibitor of miR-214-3p, increased the levels of β-catenin and reversed the depressive-like behavior in CSDS mice. Meanwhile, antagomir-214-3p increased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) and the number of dendritic spines in mPFC of CSDS mice, which may be related to the elevated expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;cldn1&lt;/span&gt;. Furthermore, intranasal administered antagomir-214-3p also significantly increased the level of β-catenin and reversed the depressive-like behaviors in CSDS mice. These results may represent a new therapeutic target for MDD.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

There has been recent interest in the temporal fluctuations of FC calculated using short time windows (“dynamic FC”) because this method could provide information inaccessible with conventional “static” FC, which is typically calculated using the entire scan lasting several tens of minutes. Although multiple studies have revealed considerable temporal fluctuations in FC, it is still unclear whether the fluctuations of FC measured in hemodynamics reflect the dynamics of underlying neural activity. We addressed this question using simultaneous imaging of neuronal calcium and hemodynamic signals in mice and found coordinated temporal dynamics of calcium FC and hemodynamic FC measured in the same short time windows. Moreover, we found that variation in transient neuronal coactivation patterns was significantly related to temporal fluctuations of sliding window FC in hemodynamics. Finally, we show that the observed dynamics of FC cannot be fully accounted for by simulated data assuming stationary FC. These results provide evidence for the neuronal origin of dynamic FC and further suggest that information relevant to FC is condensed in temporally sparse events that can be extracted using a small number of time points.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule 2 (NCAM2)-Induced c-Src-Dependent Propagation of Submembrane Ca2+ Spikes Along Dendrites Inhibits Synapse Maturation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy041</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy041/4924352?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is encoded by a gene on chromosome 21 in humans. NCAM2 accumulates in synapses, but its role in regulation of synapse formation remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that an increase in NCAM2 levels results in increased instability of dendritic protrusions and reduced conversion of protrusions to dendritic spines in mouse cortical neurons. NCAM2 overexpression induces an increase in the frequency of submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes localized in individual dendritic protrusions and promotes propagation of submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes over segments of dendrites or the whole dendritic tree. NCAM2-dependent submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes are L-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel-dependent, and their propagation but not initiation depends on the c-Src protein tyrosine kinase. Inhibition of initiation or propagation of NCAM2-dependent submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes reduces the NCAM2-dependent instability of dendritic protrusions. Synaptic boutons formed on dendrites of neurons with elevated NCAM2 expression are enriched in the protein marker of immature synapses GAP43, and the number of boutons with mature activity-dependent synaptic vesicle recycling is reduced. Our results indicate that synapse maturation is inhibited in NCAM2-overexpressing neurons and suggest that changes in NCAM2 levels and altered submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics can cause defects in synapse maturation in Down syndrome and other brain disorders associated with abnormal NCAM2 expression.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Non-perceptual Regions in the Left Inferior Parietal Lobe Support Phonological Short-term Memory: Evidence for a Buffer Account?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy037</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy037/4924349?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Buffer versus embedded processes accounts of short-term memory (STM) for phonological information were addressed by testing subjects’ perception and memory for speech and non-speech auditory stimuli. Univariate and multivariate (MVPA) approaches were used to assess whether brain regions recruited in recognizing speech were involved in maintaining speech representations over a delay. As expected, a left superior temporal region was found to support speech perception. However, contrary to the embedded processes approach, this region failed to show a load effect, or any sustained activation, during a maintenance delay. Moreover, MVPA decoding during the maintenance stage was unsuccessful in this region by a perception classifier or an encoding classifier. In contrast, the left supramarginal gyrus showed both sustained activation and a load effect. Using MVPA, stimulus decoding was successful during the delay period. In addition, a functional connectivity analysis showed that, as memory load increased, the left temporal lobe involved in perception became more strongly connected with the parietal region involved in maintenance. Taken together, the findings provide greater support for a buffer than embedded processes account of phonological STM.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Toward Leveraging Human Connectomic Data in Large Consortia: Generalizability of fMRI-Based Brain Graphs Across Sites, Sessions, and Paradigms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy032</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy032/4924348?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While graph theoretical modeling has dramatically advanced our understanding of complex brain systems, the feasibility of aggregating connectomic data in large imaging consortia remains unclear. Here, using a battery of cognitive, emotional and resting fMRI paradigms, we investigated the generalizability of functional connectomic measures across sites and sessions. Our results revealed overall fair to excellent reliability for a majority of measures during both rest and tasks, in particular for those quantifying connectivity strength, network segregation and network integration. Processing schemes such as node definition and global signal regression (GSR) significantly affected resulting reliability, with higher reliability detected for the Power atlas (vs. AAL atlas) and data without GSR. While network diagnostics for default-mode and sensori-motor systems were consistently reliable independently of paradigm, those for higher-order cognitive systems were reliable predominantly when challenged by task. In addition, based on our present sample and after accounting for observed reliability, satisfactory statistical power can be achieved in multisite research with sample size of approximately 250 when the effect size is moderate or larger. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the generalizability of brain functional graphs in large consortia, and encourage the aggregation of connectomic measures using multisite and multisession data.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) Activation Suppresses TRPV1 Sensitization in Mouse, but Not Human Sensory Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0412-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The use of human tissue to validate putative analgesic targets identified in rodents is a promising strategy for improving the historically poor translational record of preclinical pain research. We recently demonstrated that in mouse and human sensory neurons, agonists for metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3) reduce membrane hyperexcitability produced by the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Previous rodent studies indicate that mGluR2/3 can also reduce peripheral sensitization by suppressing inflammation-induced sensitization of TRPV1. Whether this observation similarly translates to human sensory neurons has not yet been tested. We found that activation of mGluR2/3 with the agonist APDC suppressed PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced sensitization of TRPV1 in mouse, but not human sensory neurons. We also evaluated sensory neuron expression of the gene transcripts for mGluR2 (&lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt;), mGluR3 (&lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;), and TRPV1 (&lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;). The majority of &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;+ mouse and human sensory neurons expressed &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;, and in both mouse and human, &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; was expressed in a greater percentage of sensory neurons than &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;. Although we demonstrated a functional difference in the modulation of TRPV1 sensitization by mGluR2/3 activation between mouse and human, there were no species differences in the gene transcript colocalization of mGluR2 or mGluR3 with TRPV1 that might explain this functional difference. Taken together with our previous work, these results suggest that mGluR2/3 activation suppresses only some aspects of human sensory neuron sensitization caused by PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These differences have implications for potential healthy human voluntary studies or clinical trials evaluating the analgesic efficacy of mGluR2/3 agonists or positive allosteric modulators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Amygdala Adaptation and Temporal Dynamics of the Salience Network in Conditioned Fear: A Single-Trial fMRI Study</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Research in rodents has established the role of the amygdaloid complex in defensive responses to conditioned threat. In human imaging studies, however, activation of the amygdala by conditioned threat cues is often not observed. One hypothesis states that this finding reflects adaptation of amygdaloid responses over time. We tested this hypothesis by estimating single-trial neural responses over a large number of conditioning trials. Functional MRI (fMRI) was recorded from 18 participants during classical differential fear conditioning: Participants viewed oriented grayscale grating stimuli (45° or 135°) presented centrally in random order. In the acquisition block, one grating (the CS+) was paired with a noxious noise, the unconditioned stimulus (US), on 25% of trials. The other grating, denoted CS–, was never paired with the US. Consistent with previous reports, BOLD in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and insula, but not the amygdala, was heightened when viewing CS+ stimuli that were not paired with US compared to CS– stimuli. Trial-by-trial analysis showed that over the course of acquisition, activity in the amygdala attenuated. Interestingly, activity in the dACC and insula also declined. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) corroborated these results, indicating that the voxel patterns evoked by CS+ and CS– in these brain regions became less distinguishable over time. Together, the present findings support the hypothesis that the lack of BOLD differences in the amygdaloid complex in many studies of classical conditioning is due to adaptation, and the adaptation effects may reflect changes in large-scale networks mediating aversive conditioning, particularly the salience network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Implementing Goal-Directed Foraging Decisions of a Simpler Nervous System in Simulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Economic decisions arise from evaluation of alternative actions in contexts of motivation and memory. In the predatory sea-slug &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt; the economic decisions of foraging are found to occur by the workings of a simple, affectively controlled homeostat with learning abilities. Here, the neuronal circuit relations for approach-avoidance choice of &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt; are expressed and tested in the foraging simulation Cyberslug. Choice is organized around appetitive state as a moment-to-moment integration of sensation, motivation (satiation/hunger), and memory. Appetitive state controls a switch for approach vs. avoidance turn responses to sensation. Sensory stimuli are separately integrated for incentive value into appetitive state, and for prey location (stimulus place) into mapping motor response. Learning interacts with satiation to regulate prey choice affectively. The virtual predator realistically reproduces the decisions of the real one in varying circumstances and satisfies optimal foraging criteria. The basic relations are open to experimental embellishment toward enhanced neural and behavioral complexity in simulation, as was the ancestral bilaterian nervous system in evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Atypical Localization and Dissociation between Glucose Uptake and Amyloid Deposition in Cognitively Normal APOE*E4 Homozygotic Elders Compared with Patients with Late-Onset Alzheimers Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progresses insidiously over decades. Therefore, study of preclinical AD is critical to identify early pathophysiological changes as potential targets for prevention or treatment. The brain processes at the preclinical stage remain minimally understood. Aside from age, the E4 allele of APOE flags a group at particularly high risk of late-onset AD (LOAD). Studies of these individuals could provide insights about the ontogenesis of AD offering clues for novel treatment strategies. To this end, cognitively normal, &lt;i&gt;APOE*E4&lt;/i&gt; homozygotes from the Alzheimer’s Diseases Neuroimaging Research Initiative database (ADNI-LONI) provided fluorodeoxyglucose and amyloid (florbetapir) PET scans (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8 and 7, respectively; mean age 76 years). Their scans were compared to those of matched cognitively normal elders who were not E4 carriers. There was dissociation in the distribution between glucose uptake and amyloid deposition in the homozygotes. Peak hypometabolism localized bilaterally along the medial temporal cortex. In contrast, peak amyloid deposition localized principally to the putamen, a finding also seen in preclinical carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations and preclinical AD associated with Down syndrome. Additional regions of amyloid deposition in homozygotes were medial prefrontal cortices including the anterior cingulate, middle and inferior frontal cortices, and middle and inferior occipital cortices. These findings contrast with those reported for LOAD. These data begin to characterize elders with normal cognition despite high AD risk in comparison to the known phenotypes of patients with LOAD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neural Determinants of Task Performance during Feature-Based Attention in Human Cortex</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Studies of feature-based attention have associated activity in a dorsal frontoparietal network with putative attentional priority signals. Yet, how this neural activity mediates attentional selection and whether it guides behavior are fundamental questions that require investigation. We reasoned that endogenous fluctuations in the quality of attentional priority should influence task performance. Human subjects detected a speed increment while viewing clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) motion (baseline task) or while attending to either direction amid distracters (attention task). In an fMRI experiment, direction-specific neural pattern similarity between the baseline task and the attention task revealed a higher level of similarity for correct than incorrect trials in frontoparietal regions. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we disrupted posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and found a selective deficit in the attention task, but not in the baseline task, demonstrating the necessity of this cortical area during feature-based attention. These results reveal that frontoparietal areas maintain attentional priority that facilitates successful behavioral selection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: {alpha}-Tubulin Acetyltransferase Is a Novel Target Mediating Neurite Growth Inhibitory Effects of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans and Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Damage to the CNS results in neuronal and axonal degeneration, and subsequent neurological dysfunction. Endogenous repair in the CNS is impeded by inhibitory chemical and physical barriers, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), which prevent axon regeneration. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the inhibition of axonal histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) can promote microtubule α-tubulin acetylation and restore the growth of CSPGs- and MAG-inhibited axons. Since the acetylation of α-tubulin is regulated by two opposing enzymes, HDAC6 (deacetylation) and α-tubulin acetyltransferase-1 (αTAT1; acetylation), we have investigated the regulation of these enzymes downstream of a growth inhibitory signal. Our findings show that exposure of primary mouse cortical neurons to soluble CSPGs and MAG substrates cause an acute and RhoA-kinase-dependent reduction in α-tubulin acetylation and αTAT1 protein levels, without changes to either HDAC6 levels or HDAC6 activity. The CSPGs- and MAG-induced reduction in αTAT1 occurs primarily in the distal and middle regions of neurites and reconstitution of αTAT1, either by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibition or lentiviral-mediated αTAT1 overexpression, can restore neurite growth. Lastly, we demonstrate that CSPGs and MAG signaling decreases αTAT1 levels posttranscriptionally via a ROCK-dependent increase in αTAT1 protein turnover. Together, these findings define αTAT1 as a novel potential therapeutic target for ameliorating CNS injury characterized by growth inhibitory substrates that are prohibitive to axonal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>A brain-imaging paper by Kastner and colleagues in 1999 was the first to demonstrate that merely focusing attention at a spatial location changed the baseline activity level in various regions of human visual cortex even before any stimuli appeared. The study provided a touchstone for investigating cognitive–sensory interactions and understanding the proactive endogenous signals that shape perception.</description>

	<description>In a series of seminal behavioral and electrophysiological experiments, Knudsen and Konishi studied the mechanisms of hearing. Their 1979 article showed how the barn owl utilizes unique anatomical features for creating a systematic internal representation of auditory space. This established the barn owl as a prime model for studying sensory systems.</description>

	<description>Manookin et al. find that parasol (magnocellular-projecting) ganglion cells of the primate retina are motion sensitive. This motion sensitivity is present in the cells’ excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, indicating that motion computations arise early in the primate visual stream.</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Theta Oscillations Organize Spiking Activity in Higher-Order Visual Thalamus during Sustained Attention</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0384-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Higher-order visual thalamus plays a fundamental but poorly understood role in attention-demanding tasks. To investigate how neuronal dynamics in higher-order visual thalamus are modulated by sustained attention, we performed multichannel electrophysiological recordings in the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex (LP/pulvinar) in the ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;). We recorded single unit activity and local field potential during the performance of the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) that is used in both humans and animals as an assay of sustained attention. We found that half of the units exhibited an increasing firing rate during the delay period before stimulus onset (attention-modulated units). In contrast, the non-attention-modulated units responded to the stimulus, but not during the delay period. Spike-field coherence of only the attention-modulated neurons significantly increased from the start of the delay period until screen touch, predominantly in the theta frequency band. In addition, theta power and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling were elevated throughout the delay period. Our findings suggest that the theta oscillation plays a role in orchestrating thalamic signaling during sustained attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Impaired sustained attention can be deadly, as illustrated by the number of motor vehicle accidents that are caused by drivers not reacting quickly enough to unexpected events on the road. Understanding how electrical signaling in higher-order visual nuclei, such as the LP/pulvinar, is modulated during tasks that require sustained attention is an important step in achieving a mechanistic understanding of sustained attention, which will eventually lead to new strategies to prevent and treat impairment in sustained attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: cAMP, cGMP and Amyloid β: Three Ideal Partners for Memory Formation</title>

	<description>cAMP and cGMP are well established second messengers required for long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory formation/consolidation. By contrast, amyloid β (Aβ), mostly known as one of the main culprits for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), has received relatively little attention in the context of plasticity and memory. Of note, however, low physiological concentrations of Aβ seem necessary for LTP induction and for memory formation. This should come as no surprise, since hormesis emerged as a central dogma in biology.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Gap Junctions Interconnect Different Subtypes of Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons in Barrels and Septa with Connectivity Unique to Each Subtype</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy038</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons form dendritic gap junctions with one another, but the connectivity among gap junction-coupled dendrites remains uninvestigated in most neocortical areas. We visualized gap junctions in layer 4 of the mouse barrel cortex and examined their structural details. PV neurons were divided into 4 types based on the location of soma and dendrites within or outside barrels. Type 1 neurons that had soma and all dendrites inside a barrel, considered most specific to single vibrissa-derived signals, unexpectedly formed gap junctions only with other types but never with each other. Type 2 neurons inside a barrel elongated dendrites outward, forming gap junctions within a column that contained the home barrel. Type 3 neurons located outside barrels established connections with all types including Type 4 neurons that were confined inside the inter-barrel septa. The majority (33/38, 86.8%) of dendritic gap junctions were within 75 μm from at least 1 of 2 paired somata. All types received vesicular glutamate transporter 2-positive axon terminals preferentially on somata and proximal dendrites, indicating the involvement of all types in thalamocortical feedforward regulation in which proximal gap junctions may also participate. These structural organizations provide a new morphological basis for regulatory mechanisms in barrel cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sfrp1 Modulates Cell-signaling Events Underlying Telencephalic Patterning, Growth and Differentiation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy013</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The mammalian dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelium develops—from medial to lateral—into the choroid plaque, cortical hem, hippocampal primordium and isocortex under the influence of Bmp, Wnt and Notch signaling. Correct telencephalic development requires a tight coordination of the extent/duration of these signals, but the identification of possible molecular coordinators is still limited. Here, we postulated that Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 1 (Sfrp1), a multifunctional regulator of Bmp, Wnt and Notch signaling strongly expressed during early telencephalic development, may represent 1 of such molecules. We report that in E10.5–E12.5 &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sfrp1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; embryos, the hem and hippocampal domains are reduced in size whereas the prospective neocortex is medially extended. These changes are associated with a significant reduction of the medio-lateral telencephalic expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Axin2&lt;/span&gt;, a read-out of Wnt/βcatenin signaling activation. Furthermore, in the absence of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sfrp1&lt;/span&gt;, Notch signaling is increased, cortical progenitor cell cycle is shorter, with expanded progenitor pools and enhanced generation of early-born neurons. Hence, in postnatal &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sfrp1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; animals the anterior hippocampus is reduced and the neocortex is shorter in the antero-posterior and medio-lateral axis but is thicker. We propose that, by controlling Wnt and Notch signaling in opposite directions, Sfrp1 promotes hippocampal patterning and balances medio-lateral and antero-posterior cortex expansion.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Temporal Dynamics of Brain Plasticity in Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy003</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy003/4911502?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cognitive training has been suggested as a possible remediation of decline in brain structure with older age. However, it is unknown whether training effects are transient or enduring, as no studies have examined training-induced plasticity relative to decline in older adults across extended periods with multiple intervention phases. We investigated the temporal dynamics of brain plasticity across periods on and off memory training, hypothesizing that (1) a decline in white matter (WM) microstructure would be observed across the duration of the study and (2) that periods of memory training would moderate the WM microstructural decline. In total, 107 older adults followed a 40-week program, including 2 training periods separated by periods with no intervention. The general decline in WM microstructure observed across the duration of the study was moderated following the training periods, demonstrating that cognitive training may mitigate age-related brain deterioration. The training-related improvements were estimated to subside over time, indicating that continuous training may be a premise for the enduring attenuation of neural decline. Memory improvements were largely maintained after the initial training period, and may thus not rely on continuous training to the same degree as WM microstructure.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Diversity of Cortico-descending Projections: Histological and Diffusion MRI Characterization in the Monkey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhx363</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx363/4911498?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The axonal composition of cortical projections originating in premotor, supplementary motor (SMA), primary motor (a4), somatosensory and parietal areas and descending towards the brain stem and spinal cord was characterized in the monkey with histological tract tracing, electron microscopy (EM) and diffusion MRI (dMRI). These 3 approaches provided complementary information. Histology provided accurate assessment of axonal diameters and size of synaptic boutons. dMRI revealed the topography of the projections (tractography), notably in the internal capsule. From measurements of axon diameters axonal conduction velocities were computed. Each area communicates with different diameter axons and this generates a hierarchy of conduction delays in this order: a4 (the shortest), SMA, premotor (F7), parietal, somatosensory, premotor F4 (the longest). We provide new interpretations for i) the well-known different anatomical and electrophysiological estimates of conduction velocity; ii) why conduction delays are probably an essential component of the cortical motor command; and iii) how histological and dMRI tractography can be integrated.&lt;/span&gt;</description>
