Epigenomic mapping of enhancer-associated chromatin modifications facilitates the genome-wide discovery of tissue-specific enhancers &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. However, reliance on single chromatin marks leads to high rates of false-positive predictions. More sophisticated, integrative methods have been described, but commonly suffer from limited accessibility to the resulting predictions and reduced biological interpretability. Here we present the Limb Enhancer Genie (LEG), a collection of highly accurate, genome-wide predictions of enhancers in the developing limb, available through a user-friendly online interface. We predict limb enhancers using a combination of &amp;gt;50 published limb-specific datasets and clusters of evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites, taking advantage of the patterns observed at previously &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; validated elements. By combining different statistical models, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and provides interpretable measures of feature importance. Our results indicate that including a previously unappreciated score that quantifies tissue-specific nuclease accessibility significantly improves prediction performance. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; validation of newly predicted elements. Moreover, we describe general features that can guide the type of datasets to include when predicting tissue-specific enhancers genome-wide, while providing an accessible resource to the general biological community and facilitating the functional interpretation of genetic studies of limb malformations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Tbw5zd-eLMc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Polymodal allosteric regulation of Type 1 Serine/Threonine Kinase Receptors via a conserved electrostatic lock</title>

Type 1 Serine/Threonine Kinase Receptors (STKR1) transduce a wide spectrum of biological signals mediated by TGF-β superfamily members. The STKR1 activity is tightly controlled by their regulatory glycine-serine rich (GS) domain adjacent to the kinase domain. Despite decades of studies, it remains unknown how physiological or pathological GS domain modifications are coupled to STKR1 kinase activity. Here, by performing molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculation of Activin-Like Kinase 2 (ALK2), we found that GS domain phosphorylation, FKBP12 dissociation, and disease mutations all destabilize a D354-R375 salt-bridge, which normally acts as an electrostatic lock to prevent coordination of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the catalytic site. We developed a WAFEX-guided principal analysis and unraveled how phosphorylation destabilizes this highly conserved salt-bridge in temporal and physical space. Using current-flow betweenness scores, we identified an allosteric network of residue-residue contacts between the GS domain and the catalytic site that controls the formation and disruption of this salt bridge. Importantly, our novel network analysis approach revealed how certain disease-causing mutations bypass FKBP12-mediated kinase inhibition to produce leaky signaling in the absence of ligand. We further provide experimental evidence that this salt-bridge lock exists in other STKR1s, and acts as a general safety mechanism in STKR1 to prevent pathological leaky signaling. In summary, our study provides a compelling and unifying allosteric activation mechanism in STKR1 kinases that reconciles a large number of experimental studies and sheds light on a novel therapeutic avenue to target disease-related STKR1 mutants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KkneVn381dc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Host population structure impedes reversion to drug sensitivity after discontinuation of treatment</title>

Intense use of antibiotics for the treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; or gonorrhea has led to rapidly increasing population levels of drug resistance. This has generally necessitated a switch to new drugs and the discontinuation of older ones, after which resistance often only declines slowly or even persists indefinitely. These long-term effects are usually ascribed to low fitness costs of resistance in absence of the drug. Here we show that structure in the host population, in particular heterogeneity in number of contacts, also plays an important role in the reversion dynamics. Host contact structure acts both during the phase of intense treatment, leading to non-random distributions of the resistant strain among the infected population, and after the discontinuation of the drug, by affecting the competition dynamics resulting in a mitigation of fitness advantages. As a consequence, we observe both a lower rate of reversion and a lower probability that reversion to sensitivity on the population level occurs after treatment is stopped. Our simulations show that the impact of heterogeneity in the host structure is maximal in the biologically most plausible parameter range, namely when fitness costs of resistance are small.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aEDhdmGO1Us&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spatial dynamics of synthetic microbial mutualists and their parasites</title>

A major force contributing to the emergence of novelty in nature is the presence of cooperative interactions, where two or more components of a system act in synergy, sometimes leading to higher-order, emergent phenomena. Within molecular evolution, the so called &lt;i&gt;hypercycle&lt;/i&gt; defines the simplest model of an autocatalytic cycle, providing major theoretical insights on the evolution of cooperation in the early biosphere. These closed cooperative loops have also inspired our understanding of how catalytic loops appear in ecological systems. In both cases, hypercycle and ecological cooperative loops, the role played by space seems to be crucial for their stability and resilience against parasites. However, it is difficult to test these ideas in natural ecosystems, where time and spatial scales introduce considerable limitations. Here, we use engineered bacteria as a model system to a variety of environmental scenarios identifying trends that transcend the specific model system, such an enhanced genetic diversity in environments requiring mutualistic interactions. Interestingly, we show that improved environments can slow down mutualistic range expansions as a result of genetic drift effects preceding local resource depletion. Moreover, we show that a parasitic strain is excluded from the population during range expansions (which acknowledges a classical prediction). Nevertheless, environmental deterioration can reshape population interactions, this same strain becoming part of a three-species mutualistic web in scenarios in which the two-strain mutualism becomes non functional. The evolutionary and ecological implications for the design of synthetic ecosystems are outlined.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-lmZyb2t8MA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Neuron’s eye view: Inferring features of complex stimuli from neural responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005645</guid>

Experiments that study neural encoding of stimuli at the level of individual neurons typically choose a small set of features present in the world—contrast and luminance for vision, pitch and intensity for sound—and assemble a stimulus set that systematically varies along these dimensions. Subsequent analysis of neural responses to these stimuli typically focuses on regression models, with experimenter-controlled features as predictors and spike counts or firing rates as responses. Unfortunately, this approach requires knowledge in advance about the relevant features coded by a given population of neurons. For domains as complex as social interaction or natural movement, however, the relevant feature space is poorly understood, and an arbitrary &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; choice of features may give rise to confirmation bias. Here, we present a Bayesian model for exploratory data analysis that is capable of automatically identifying the features present in unstructured stimuli based solely on neuronal responses. Our approach is unique within the class of latent state space models of neural activity in that it assumes that firing rates of neurons are sensitive to multiple discrete time-varying features tied to the &lt;i&gt;stimulus&lt;/i&gt;, each of which has Markov (or semi-Markov) dynamics. That is, we are modeling neural activity as driven by multiple simultaneous stimulus features rather than intrinsic neural dynamics. We derive a fast variational Bayesian inference algorithm and show that it correctly recovers hidden features in synthetic data, as well as ground-truth stimulus features in a prototypical neural dataset. To demonstrate the utility of the algorithm, we also apply it to cluster neural responses and demonstrate successful recovery of features corresponding to monkeys and faces in the image set.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y_WuW3DO4Dw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Insufficient sleep: Enhanced risk-seeking relates to low local sleep intensity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25023</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Chronic sleep restriction is highly prevalent in modern society and is in its clinical form, insufficient sleep syndrome, one of the most prevalent diagnoses in clinical sleep laboratories, with substantial negative impact on health and community burden. It reflects every-day sleep loss better than acute sleep deprivation, but its effects and particularly the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown for a variety of critical cognitive domains, as for example risky decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We assessed financial risk-taking behavior after 7 consecutive nights of sleep restriction and after one night of acute sleep deprivation compared to a regular sleep condition in a within-subject design. We further investigated potential underlying mechanisms of sleep loss induced changes in behavior by high-density electroencephalography recordings during restricted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We show that chronic sleep restriction increases risk-seeking, while this was not observed after acute sleep deprivation. This increase was subjectively not noticed and was related to locally lower values of slow wave energy during preceding sleep, an electrophysiological marker of sleep intensity and restoration, in electrodes over the right prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: This study provides for the first time evidence that insufficient sleep restoration over circumscribed cortical areas leads to aberrant behavior. In chronically sleep restricted subjects, low slow wave sleep intensity over the right prefrontal cortex - which has been shown to be linked to risk behavior – may lead to increased and subjectively unnoticed risk-seeking.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We solve an adaptive search model where a random walker or L\'evy flight
stochastically resets to previously visited sites on a $d$-dimensional lattice
containing one trapping site. Due to reinforcement, a phase transition occurs
when the resetting rate crosses a threshold above which non-diffusive
stationary states emerge, localized around the inhomogeneity. The threshold
depends on the trapping strength and on the walker's return probability in the
memoryless case. The transition belongs to the same class as the
self-consistent theory of Anderson localization. These results show that
similarly to many living organisms and unlike the well-studied Markovian walks,
non-Markov movement processes can allow agents to learn about their environment
and promise to bring adaptive solutions in search tasks.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Progressive reconfiguration of resting-state brain networks as psychosis develops: Preliminary results from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) consortium</title>

	<description>Mounting evidence has shown disrupted brain network architecture across the psychosis spectrum. However, whether these changes relate to the development of psychosis is unclear. Here, we used graph theoretical analysis to investigate longitudinal changes in resting-state brain networks in samples of 72 subjects at clinical high risk (including 8 cases who converted to full psychosis) and 48 healthy controls drawn from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) consortium. We observed progressive reduction in global efficiency (P = 0.006) and increase in network diversity (P = 0.001) in converters compared with non-converters and controls. More refined analysis separating nodes into nine key brain networks demonstrated that these alterations were primarily driven by progressively diminished local efficiency in the default-mode network (P = 0.004) and progressively enhanced node diversity across all networks (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The change rates of network efficiency and network diversity were significantly correlated (P = 0.003), suggesting these changes may reflect shared underlying neural mechanisms. In addition, change rates of global efficiency and node diversity were significantly correlated with change rate of cortical thinning in the prefrontal cortex in converters (P &amp;lt; 0.03) and could be predicted by visuospatial memory scores at baseline (P &amp;lt; 0.04). These results provide preliminary evidence for longitudinal reconfiguration of resting-state brain networks during psychosis development and suggest that decreased network efficiency, reflecting an increase in path length between nodes, and increased network diversity, reflecting a decrease in the consistency of functional network organization, are implicated in the progression to full psychosis.</description>

	<description>Long-distance olfactory search behaviors depend on odor detection dynamics. Due to turbulence, olfactory signals travel as bursts of variable concentration and spacing and are characterized by long-tail distributions of odor/no-odor events, challenging the computing capacities of olfactory systems. How animals encode complex olfactory scenes to track the plume far from the source remains unclear. Here we focus on the coding of the plume temporal dynamics in moths. We compare responses of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs) to sequences of pheromone stimuli either with white-noise patterns or with realistic turbulent temporal structures simulating a large range of distances (8 to 64 m) from the odor source. For the first time, we analyze what information is extracted by the olfactory system at large distances from the source. Neuronal responses are analyzed using linear-nonlinear models fitted with white-noise stimuli and used for predicting responses to turbulent stimuli. We found that neuronal firing rate is less correlated with the dynamic odor time course when distance to the source increases because of improper coding during long odor and no-odor events that characterize large distances. Rapid adaptation during long puffs does not preclude however the detection of puff transitions in PNs. Individual PNs but not individual ORNs encode the onset and offset of odor puffs for any temporal structure of stimuli. A higher spontaneous firing rate coupled to an inhibition phase at the end of PN responses contributes to this coding property. This allows PNs to decode the temporal structure of the odor plume at any distance to the source, an essential piece of information moths can use in their tracking behavior.</description>

	<description>The superficial interneurons, SINs, of the zebrafish tectum, also known as tectal horizontal cells, have been implicated in a range of behavioral responses to visual cues, including prey capture and looming-evoked escape. However, there is limited information on their tuning properties, synaptic connectivity and molecular diversity. We have begun to close this gap in our knowledge by performing functional GCaMP6 imaging and electrophysiological recordings of SIN responses to simplified stimuli. We found that a large subset of the SINs strongly responded to luminance changes, with a preference for OFF steps. Although SINs were generally tuned to any dark-light, or light-dark, transition, they were often most sensitive to a narrow range of luminance steps. Tuning properties did not vary with the position of the SIN cell body along the depth of the tectal neuropil or with the orientation of the cell neurites within the neuropil. Receptive field (RF) mapping revealed that SINs sample over large areas of the visual field (greater than 20 degrees, typically 50 degrees). RFs of individual SINs were sometimes spatially incoherent, indicating that SINs may receive sparse inputs from multiple RGCs scattered widely over the retina. Lastly, we found that, while most SINs express GABAergic markers, as reported before, a substantial minority express a vesicular glutamate transporter. We propose that the role of the SINs is more complex than previously reported, and provide evidence that at least one SIN subtype could function as a multi-purpose circuit element for signaling changes in ambient luminance for subsequent processing in the tectum.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Multimodal Surface Matching with Higher-Order Smoothness Constraints</title>

	<description>The accurate alignment of brains is fundamental to the statistical sensitivity and spatial localisation of group studies in brain imaging, and cortical surface-based alignment is generally accepted to be superior to volume-based approaches at aligning cortical areas. However, human subjects have considerable variation in cortical folding, and in the location of cortical areas relative to these folds, which makes aligning cortical areas based on folding alone a challenging problem. The Multimodal Surface Matching (MSM) tool is a flexible spherical registration approach that enables accurate registration of surfaces based on a variety of different features. Using MSM, we have previously shown that using areal features such as resting state-networks and myelin maps to drive cross-subject surface alignment improves group task fMRI statistics and map sharpness. However, the initial implementation of MSM's regularisation function did not penalize all forms of surface distortion evenly. In some cases, this allowed peak distortions to exceed neurobiologically plausible limits unless the regularisation strength was increased, in which case this prevented the algorithm from fully maximizing surface alignment. Here, we propose a new regularisation penalty, derived from physically relevant equations of strain (deformation) energy, and demonstrate that its use leads to improved and more robust alignment of multi-modal imaging data. In addition, since spherical warps incorporate projection distortions that are unavoidable when mapping from a convoluted cortical surface to the sphere, we also propose constraints to enforce smooth deformation of cortical anatomies. We test the impact of this approach for longitudinal modeling of cortical development for neonates (born between 32 and 45 weeks) and demonstrate that the proposed method increases the biological interpretability of the distortion fields and improves the statistical significance of population-based analysis relative to other spherical methods.</description>

	<description>The frontoparietal control network (FPCN) plays a central role in executive control. It has been predominantly viewed as a unitary domain general system. Here, we examined patterns of FPCN functional connectivity (FC) across multiple conditions of varying cognitive demands, in order to test for FPCN heterogeneity. We identified two distinct subsystems within the FPCN based on hierarchical clustering and machine learning classification analyses of within-FPCN FC patterns. These two FPCN subsystems exhibited distinct patterns of FC the default network (DN) and the dorsal attentional network (DAN). This 2-fold FPCN differentiation was observed across four independent data sets, across 9 different conditions (rest and 8 tasks), as well as in meta-analytic co-activation patterns. The extent of FPCN differentiation varied across conditions, suggesting flexible adaptation to task demands. These findings reveal a flexible and heterogeneous FPCN organization that may in part emerge from separable DN and DAN processing streams.</description>

	<description>In the ocean, the crab, Cancer borealis, is subject to daily and seasonal temperature changes. Previous work, done in the presence of descending modulatory inputs, had shown that the pyloric rhythm of the crab increases in frequency as temperature increases, but maintains its characteristic phase relationships until it 'crashes' at extreme high temperatures. To study the interaction between neuromodulators and temperature perturbations, we studied the effects of temperature on preparations from which the descending modulatory inputs were removed. Under these conditions the pyloric rhythm was destabilized. We then studied the effects of temperature on preparations in the presence of oxotremorine, proctolin, and serotonin. Oxotremorine and proctolin enhanced the robustness of the pyloric rhythm, while serotonin made the rhythm less robust. These experiments reveal considerable animal-to-animal diversity in their crash stability, consistent with the interpretation that cryptic differences in many cell and network parameters are revealed by extreme perturbations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Using Outliers in Freesurfer Segmentation Statistics to Identify Cortical Reconstruction Errors in Structural Scans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/176818v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Introduction: Quality assurance (QA) is vital for ensuring the integrity of processed neuroimaging data for use in clinical neurosciences research. Manual QA (visual inspection) of processed brains for cortical surface reconstruction errors is resource-intensive, particularly with large datasets. Several semi-automated QA tools use quantitative detection of subjects for editing based on outlier brain regions. There were two project goals: (1) evaluate the adequacy of a statistical QA method relative to visual inspection, and (2) examine whether error identification and correction significantly impacts estimation of cortical parameters and established brain-behavior relationships. Methods: T1 MPRAGE images (N = 530) of healthy adults were obtained from the NKI-Rockland Sample and reconstructed using Freesurfer 5.3. Visual inspection of T1 images was conducted for: (1) participants (n = 110) with outlier values (z scores +/- 3 SD) for subcortical and cortical segmentation volumes (outlier group), and (2) a random sample of remaining participants (n = 110) with segmentation values that did not meet the outlier criterion (non-outlier group). Results: The outlier group had 21% more participants with visual inspection-identified errors than participants in the non-outlier group, with a medium effect size ({Phi} = 0.22). Nevertheless, a considerable portion of images with errors of cortical extension were found in the non-outlier group (41%). Sex significantly predicted error rate; men were 2.8 times more likely to have errors than women. Although nine brain regions significantly changed size from pre- to post-editing (with effect sizes ranging from 0.26 to 0.59), editing did not substantially change the correlations of neurocognitive tasks and brain volumes (ps &amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Statistically-based QA, although less resource intensive, is not accurate enough to supplant visual inspection. We discuss practical implications of our findings to guide resource allocation decisions for image processing.</description>

	<description>Physical exercise in combination with cognitive training is known to enhance synaptic plasticity and lower the risk for various complex diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that exposure of adult male mice to an environmental enrichment paradigm leads to long-lasting enhancement of synaptic plasticity that is also passed on to the next generation. We show that the effect is mediated through sperm RNA and is explained by microRNAs 212/132. In conclusion, our study reports intergenerational inheritance of an acquired cognitive benefit and points to specific microRNAs as candidates mechanistically involved in this type of transmission.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Innovations orthogonalization: a solution to the major pitfalls of EEG/MEG &quot;leakage correction&quot;</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/178657v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/178657v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The problem of interest here is the study of brain functional and effective connectivity based non-invasive EEG-MEG inverse solution time series. These signals generally have low spatial resolution, such that an estimated signal at any one site is an instantaneous linear mixture of the true, actual, unobserved signals across all cortical sites. False connectivity can result from analysis of these low-resolution signals. Recent efforts toward &quot;unmixing&quot; have been developed, under the name of &quot;leakage correction&quot;. One recent noteworthy approach is that by Colclough et al (2015 NeuroImage, 117:439-448), which forces the inverse solution signals to have zero cross-correlation at lag zero. One goal is to show that Colclough's method produces false human connectomes under very broad conditions. The second major goal is to develop a new solution, that appropriately &quot;unmixes&quot; the inverse solution signals, based on innovations orthogonalization. The new method first fits a multivariate autoregression to the inverse solution signals, giving the mixed innovations. Second, the mixed innovations are orthogonalized. Third, the mixed and orthogonalized innovations allow the estimation of the &quot;unmixing&quot; matrix, which is then finally used to &quot;unmix&quot; the inverse solution signals. It is shown that under very broad conditions, the new method produces proper human connectomes, even when the signals are not generated by an autoregressive model.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The functional and genetic associations of neuroimaging data: a toolbox</title>

	<description>Advances in neuroimaging and sequencing techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to map the function of brain regions and to identify the roots of psychiatric diseases. However, the results generated by most neuroimaging studies, i.e., activated clusters/regions or functional connectivities between brain regions, frequently cannot be conveniently and systematically interpreted, rendering the biological meaning unclear. We describe a Brain Annotation Toolbox (BAT), a toolbox that helps to generate functional and genetic annotations for neuroimaging results. The toolbox can take data from brain regions identified with an atlas, or from brain regions identified as activated in tasks, or from functional connectivity links or networks of links. Then, the voxel-level functional description from the Neurosynth database and the gene expression profile from the Allen Brain Atlas are used to generate functional and genetic knowledge for such region-level data. Parametric (Fisher's exact test) or non-parametric (permutation test) statistical tests are adopted to identify significantly related functional descriptors and genes for the neuroimaging results. The validity of the approach is demonstrated by showing that the functional and genetic annotations for specific brain regions are consistent with each other; and further the region by region functional similarity network and gene co-expression networks are highly correlated for many major brain atlases. One application of BAT is to help provide functional and genetic annotations for the newly discovered regions with unknown functions, e.g., the 97 new regions identified in the Human Connectome Project. Importantly too, this toolbox can help understand differences between patients with psychiatric disorders and controls, and this is demonstrated using data for schizophrenia and autism, for which the functional and genetic annotations for the neuroimaging data differences between patients and controls are consistent with each other and help with the interpretation of the differences.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Intrinsic functional connectivity of the central extended amygdala</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/178533v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The central extended amygdala (EAc) -- including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) -- plays a key role in orchestrating states of fear and anxiety and is implicated in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse. Although it is widely thought that these disorders reflect the coordinated actions of large-scale functional circuits in the brain, the architecture of the EAc functional network, and the degree to which the BST and the Ce show distinct patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity, remains incompletely understood. Here, we leveraged a combination of approaches to trace the connectivity of the BST and the Ce in 130 psychiatrically healthy, racially diverse, community-dwelling adults with enhanced power and precision. Multiband imaging, high-precision data registration techniques, and spatially unsmoothed data were used to maximize anatomical specificity. Using newly developed seed regions, whole-brain regression analyses revealed robust functional connectivity between the BST and Ce via the sublenticular extended amygdala (substantia innominata), the ribbon of subcortical gray matter encompassing the ventral amygdalofugal pathway. Both regions displayed significant coupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), midcingulate cortex (MCC), insula, and anterior hippocampus. The BST showed significantly stronger connectivity with prefrontal territories -- including the vmPFC, anterior MCC and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex -- as well as the thalamus, striatum, and the periaqueductal gray. The only regions showing stronger functional connectivity with the Ce were located in the anterior hippocampus and dorsal amygdala. These observations provide a baseline against which to compare a range of special populations, inform our understanding of the role of the EAc in normal and pathological fear and anxiety, and highlight the value of several new approaches to image registration which may be particularly useful for researchers working with anatomically de-identified neuroimaging data.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Behavioral and neural indices of affective coloring for neutral social stimuli</title>

	<description>Emotional processing often continues beyond the duration of emotionally evocative stimuli, resulting in affective biasing or coloring of subsequently encountered events. Here, we describe neural correlates of affective coloring and examine how individual differences in affective style impact the magnitude of affective coloring. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging in 117 adults who passively viewed negative, neutral, and positive pictures presented 2s prior to neutral faces. Brain responses to neutral faces were modulated by the valence of preceding pictures, with greater activation for faces following negative (vs. positive) pictures in the amygdala (particularly for older adults), dorsomedial and lateral prefrontal cortex, ventral visual cortices, posterior superior temporal sulcus, and angular gyrus. Three days after the MRI scan, participants rated their memory and liking of previously encountered neutral faces. Individuals higher in trait positive affect and emotional reappraisal rated faces as more likable when preceded by emotionally arousing (negative or positive) pictures. Additionally, greater amygdala responses to neutral faces preceded by positively valenced pictures predicted greater memory for these faces three days later. Collectively, these results reveal individual differences in how emotions spill over onto the processing of unrelated social stimuli, resulting in persistent and affectively biased evaluations of such stimuli.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Trajectories of Alcohol Use Initiation and Risk to Develop an Alcohol Use Disorder During Adolescence: A Role for Stress and Amygdala Activity</title>

	<description>Early alcohol use initiation predicts onset of alcohol use disorders (AUD) in adulthood. However, little is known about developmental trajectories of alcohol use initiation or their putative biological and environmental correlates. Here we report the results of latent class analyses identifying two trajectories of alcohol use initiation in a prospective study of adolescents selected for the presence or absence of familial risk for depression at baseline. The latent class analyses identified two distinct patterns of initiation: early initiators (EI; n=32) who reported greater baseline alcohol use (M = 1.12, SE = .35) and exhibited a more rapid rate of change in use between baseline and each follow up wave (M = 4.43, SE = .94); and in contrast, late initiators (LI; n=298) who reported lower baseline use (M = .23, SE = .03) and exhibited a slower rate of change between baseline and each of the subsequent follow up waves (M = .12, SE = .03). Early initiators had more positive expectancies regarding alcohol (p = .002 - p = .005) and reported higher levels of stressful life events during the year prior to baseline assessment (p = .001). Additionally, fMRI analyses revealed that EI displayed heightened threat-related amygdala activity at baseline compared to LI (p = .001), but no differences in reward-related ventral striatum activity. Lastly survival analyses revealed that EI initiators were 6.7 times more likely to develop an AUD by age 19 when compared to the LI (p = .005). These patterns, which were independent of broad familial risk for depression, suggest that early initiation of alcohol use during adolescence associated with later risk for AUD is reflected in both higher levels of stressful life events and higher neural reactivity to threat, the combination of which may inform ongoing efforts to prevent persistent dysfunction.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Awake fMRI Reveals Mechanisms of Language Comprehension in Dogs</title>

	<description>To what extent do dogs understand human language? At a basic level, lexical processing would require the differentiation of words from non-words, while semantic processing would further require the recognition of word meaning. To determine the level of language processing, we trained 12 dogs to retrieve two objects based on object names, then probed the neural basis for these auditory representations using awake-fMRI. As a control, we compared the neural response to pseudowords versus trained words, and novel objects versus trained objects during the fMRI scan. If dogs lexically processed the trained words, then a differential auditory response would be predicted to occur to trained words relative to pseudowords. Moreover, if dogs used semantic processing, there should be a difference in activation between the two trained words. In support of lexical processing, we found greater activation for pseudowords relative to trained words bilaterally in the parietotemporal cortex, but no activation difference between the two trained words. However, multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed statistically significant clusters of informative voxels for the two trained words in the thalamus, left temporoparietal region, and left caudate nucleus. These results suggest a different mechanism of language comprehension than in humans. The dogs' greater activation for pseudowords in the parietotemporal cortex indicates an underlying bias for novelty rather than semantic processing of words as object-referents, while the MVPA results suggest a potential link between words/sounds and motor action.</description>

	<description>Synesthesia is a condition wherein one sense is evoked by another. Recent studies suggested a higher incidence of synesthesia among people with autism. However, the underlying circuit mechanism of the comorbidity remains unknown partly due to lack of animal models. Here, we measured auditory response of primary visual cortex (V1) in mouse models to estimate the mixture level of their senses. We found that the V1 auditory response exhibits bidirectional cross-modal plasticity and depends on the level of GABA-mediated inhibition. Analysis of the V1 auditory response in autistic BTBR strain revealed its contralateral bias as in primary auditory cortex, and the auditory evoked field potential was enhanced at gamma range. Furthermore, early sound-driven spike modulation of V1 was commonly shifted toward enhancement in three different autism models (BTBR, NL3 R451C, SCN1A R1407X). Disruption of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) circuit balance is prevalent among autistic people and mouse models. Thus, our results suggest that E/I imbalance may be the common circuit dysfunction for both autism and synesthesia.</description>

Fibrin(ogen) deposition is neurotoxic in animal models of MS, but has not been evaluated in human progressive MS cortex. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent and distribution of fibrin(ogen) in progressive MS cortex and elucidate its relationship with neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24997-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A postmortem cohort of pathologically confirmed MS (n = 47) and control (n = 10) cases was used. The extent and distribution of fibrin(ogen) was assessed and related to measures of demyelination, inflammation, and neuronal density. In a subset of cases (MS, n = 20; control, n = 10), expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), a key enzyme in the fibrinolytic cascade, was assessed and related to the extent of fibrin(ogen).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24997-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motor cortical fibrin(ogen) deposition was significantly over-represented in MS compared to control cases in all compartments studied (ie, extracellular [&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001], cell body [&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003], and neuritic/glial-processes [&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004]). MS cases with high levels of extracellular fibrin(ogen) had significantly upregulated PAI-1 expression in all cortical layers assessed (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and reduced neuronal density (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.017), including in the functionally-relevant layer 5 (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Progressive MS cases with severe fibrin(ogen) deposition have significantly reduced neuronal density. Future studies are needed to elucidate the provenance and putative neurotoxicity of fibrin(ogen), and its potential impact on clinical disability.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Distributed cortical structural properties contribute to motor cortical excitability and inhibition</title>

	<description>The link between the local structure of the primary motor cortex and motor function has been well documented. However, motor function relies on a network of interconnected brain regions and the link between the structural properties characterizing these distributed brain networks and motor function remains poorly understood. Here, we examined whether distributed patterns of brain structure, extending beyond the primary motor cortex can help classify two forms of motor function: corticospinal excitability and intracortical inhibition. To this effect, we recorded high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging scans in 25 healthy volunteers. To measure corticospinal excitability and inhibition in the same volunteers we recorded motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in a separate session. Support vector machine (SVM) pattern classification was used to identify distributed multivoxel gray matter areas, which distinguished subjects who had lower and higher MEPs and SICIs. We found that MEP and SICI classification could be predicted based on a widely distributed, largely non-overlapping pattern of voxels in the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital and cerebellar regions. Thus, structural properties distributed over the brain beyond the primary motor cortex relate to motor function.</description>

Our work focuses on the stability, resilience, and response to perturbation of the bacterial communities in the human gut. Informative flash flood-like disturbances that eliminate most gastrointestinal biomass can be induced using a clinically-relevant iso-osmotic agent. We designed and executed such a disturbance in human volunteers using a dense longitudinal sampling scheme extending before and after induced diarrhea. This experiment has enabled a careful multidomain analysis of a controlled perturbation of the human gut microbiota with a new level of resolution. These new longitudinal multidomain data were analyzed using recently developed statistical methods that demonstrate improvements over current practices. By imposing sparsity constraints we have enhanced the interpretability of the analyses and by employing a new adaptive generalized principal components analysis, incorporated modulated phylogenetic information and enhanced interpretation through scoring of the portions of the tree most influenced by the perturbation. Our analyses leverage the taxa-sample duality in the data to show how the gut microbiota recovers following this perturbation. Through a holistic approach that integrates phylogenetic, metagenomic and abundance information, we elucidate patterns of taxonomic and functional change that characterize the community recovery process across individuals. We provide complete code and illustrations of new sparse statistical methods for high-dimensional, longitudinal multidomain data that provide greater interpretability than existing methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bi_0OACHraE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lingfei Wang, Tom Michoel&lt;/p&gt;

Mapping gene expression as a quantitative trait using whole genome-sequencing and transcriptome analysis allows to discover the functional consequences of genetic variation. We developed a novel method and ultra-fast software Findr for higly accurate causal inference between gene expression traits using cis-regulatory DNA variations as causal anchors, which improves current methods by taking into consideration hidden confounders and weak regulations. Findr outperformed existing methods on the DREAM5 Systems Genetics challenge and on the prediction of microRNA and transcription factor targets in human lymphoblastoid cells, while being nearly a million times faster. Findr is publicly available at https://github.com/lingfeiwang/findr.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jwKwMNrRg0w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Extracting replicable associations across multiple studies: Empirical Bayes algorithms for controlling the false discovery rate</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by David Amar, Ron Shamir, Daniel Yekutieli&lt;/p&gt;

In almost every field in genomics, large-scale biomedical datasets are used to report associations. Extracting associations that recur across multiple studies while controlling the false discovery rate is a fundamental challenge. Here, we propose a new method to allow joint analysis of multiple studies. Given a set of p-values obtained from each study, the goal is to identify associations that recur in at least &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 1 studies while controlling the false discovery rate. We propose several new algorithms that differ in how the study dependencies are modeled, and compare them and extant methods under various simulated scenarios. The top algorithm, SCREEN (Scalable Cluster-based REplicability ENhancement), is our new algorithm that works in three stages: (1) clustering an estimated correlation network of the studies, (2) learning replicability (e.g., of genes) within clusters, and (3) merging the results across the clusters. When we applied SCREEN to two real datasets it greatly outperformed the results obtained via standard meta-analysis. First, on a collection of 29 case-control gene expression cancer studies, we detected a large set of consistently up-regulated genes related to proliferation and cell cycle regulation. These genes are both consistently up-regulated across many cancer studies, and are well connected in known gene networks. Second, on a recent pan-cancer study that examined the expression profiles of patients with and without mutations in the HLA complex, we detected a large active module of up-regulated genes that are both related to immune responses and are well connected in known gene networks. This module covers thrice more genes as compared to the original study at a similar false discovery rate, demonstrating the high power of SCREEN. An implementation of SCREEN is available in the supplement.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YRu4NDFR8Wk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: T1-/T2-weighted ratio differs in demyelinated cortex of multiple sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detecting cortical demyelination in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is difficult. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ratio maps of T1-weighted and T2-weighted images (T1w/T2w) may be sensitive to cortical myelin levels. In this MRI-histological study, postmortem in situ scans were acquired from six cadavers with MS on a 3 Tesla MRI. Immunocytochemistry was used to correlate myelin status and cortical T1w/T2w measures. The results showed that the T1w/T2w values significantly differed between demyelinated and myelinated cortex (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The T1w/T2w ratio maps may be a relatively simple, clinically feasible method to assess cortical demyelination. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In multiple sclerosis, neuropathological studies have shown widespread changes in the cerebral cortex. In vivo imaging is critical since the histopathological substrate of most measurements is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a novel MRI analysis technique, based on the ratio of T1- and T2-weighted signal intensities, we studied the cerebral cortex of a large cohort of patients in early stages of multiple sclerosis. 168 patients with clinically isolated syndrome or relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (Expanded Disability Status Scale: median, 1; range, 0-3.5) and 80 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were investigated. We also searched for the histopathological substrate of the T1/T2-weighted ratio by combining post mortem imaging and histopathology in 9 multiple sclerosis brain donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients showed lower T1/T2-weighted ratio values in parietal and occipital areas. The four most significant clusters appeared in the medial occipital and posterior cingulate cortex (each left and right). The decrease of the T1/T2-weighted ratio in the posterior cingulate was related to performance in attention. Analysis of the T1/T2-weighted ratio values of post mortem imaging yielded a strong correlation with dendrite density but none of the other parameters including myelin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The T1/T2-weighted ratio decreases in early stages of multiple sclerosis in a widespread manner with a preponderance of posterior areas and with a contribution to attentional performance; it seems to reflect dendrite pathology. As the method is broadly available and applicable to (available) clinical scans, we believe that it is a promising candidate for studying and monitoring cortical pathology or therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Axonal components of nerves innervating the human arm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25018</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Axons travelling within the brachial plexus are responsible for the dexterous control of human arm and hand movements. Despite comprehensive knowledge on the topographical anatomy of nerves innervating the human upper limb, the definite quantity of sensory and motor axons within this neural network remains elusive. Our aim was to perform a quantitative analysis of the axonal components of human upper limb nerves based on highly specific molecular features from spinal cord level to the terminal nerves at wrist level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Nerve specimen harvest at pre-defined harvesting sites (plexus roots and cords as well as major nerves originating from the brachial plexus innervating the arm and hand) was performed in nine human heart-beating organ donors. Double immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against choline-acetyltransferase and neurofilament was performed to differentiate motor and sensory axons on nerve cross sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: 350.000 axons emerge from the spinal cord to innervate the human upper limb of which 10% are motor neurons. In all nerves studied sensory axons outnumber motor axons by a ratio of at least 9:1. The sensory axon contribution increases when moving distally while only 1.700 motor axons reach the hand to innervate the intrinsic musculature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results suggest that upper limb motor execution, and particularly dexterous coordination of hand movement require an unexpectedly low number of motor neurons, with a large convergence of afferent input for feedback control.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Persistent seizure control in epileptic mice transplanted with GABA progenitors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25021</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25021</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significant proportion of the more than 50 million people world-wide currently suffering with epilepsy are resistant to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). As an alternative to AEDs, novel therapies based on cell transplantation offer an opportunity for long-lasting modification of epileptic circuits. To develop such a treatment requires careful preclinical studies in a chronic epilepsy model featuring unprovoked seizures, hippocampal histopathology, and behavioral comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transplantation of progenitor cells from embryonic medial or caudal ganglionic eminence (MGE, CGE) were made in a well-characterized mouse model of status epilepticus-induced epilepsy (systemic pilocarpine). Behavioral testing (handling and open field), continuous video-electroencephalographic (vEEG) monitoring and slice electrophysiology outcomes were obtained up to 270 days after transplantation (DAT). &lt;em&gt;Post hoc&lt;/em&gt; immunohistochemistry was used to confirm cell identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MGE progenitors transplanted into the hippocampus of epileptic mice rescued handling and open field deficits starting at 60 DAT. In these same mice, an 84-88% reduction in seizure activity was observed between 180 and 210 DAT. Inhibitory postsynaptic current frequency, measured on pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices at 270 DAT, was reduced in epileptic mice but restored to naïve levels in epileptic mice receiving MGE transplants. No reduction in seizure activity was observed in epileptic mice receiving intra-hippocampal CGE progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate that transplanted MGE progenitors enhance functional GABA-mediated inhibition, reduce spontaneous seizure frequency and rescue behavioral deficits in a chronic epileptic animal model more than six months after treatment.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Inhibiting persistent inward sodium currents prevents myotonia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25017</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Patients with myotonia congenita have muscle hyperexcitability due to loss-of-function mutations in the ClC-1 chloride channel in skeletal muscle, which causes involuntary firing of muscle action potentials (myotonia), producing muscle stiffness. The excitatory events that trigger myotonic action potentials in the absence of stabilizing ClC-1 current are not fully understood. Our goal was to identify currents that trigger spontaneous firing of muscle in the setting of reduced ClC-1 current.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; intracellular current clamp and voltage clamp recordings were performed in muscle from a mouse model of myotonia congenita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Intracellular recordings revealed a slow after-depolarization (AfD) that triggers myotonic action potentials. The after depolarization is well-explained by a tetrododoxin-sensitive and voltage-dependent Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; persistent inward current (NaPIC). Notably, this NaPIC undergoes slow inactivation over seconds, suggesting this may contribute to the end of myotonic runs. Highlighting the significance of this mechanism, we found that ranolazine and elevated serum divalent cations eliminate myotonia by inhibiting AfD and NaPIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: This work significantly changes our understanding of the mechanisms triggering myotonia. Our work suggests that the current focus of treating myotonia, blocking the transient Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current underlying action potentials, is an inefficient approach. We show that inhibiting NaPIC is paralleled by elimination of myotonia. We suggest the ideal myotonia therapy would selectively block NaPIC and spare the transient Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Data assimilation, defined as the fusion of data with preexisting knowledge,
is particularly suited to elucidating underlying phenomena from
noisy/insufficient observations. Although this approach has been widely used in
diverse fields, only recently have efforts been directed to problems in
neuroscience, using mainly intracranial data and thus limiting its
applicability to invasive measurements involving electrode implants. Here we
intend to apply data assimilation to non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
measurements to infer brain states and their characteristics. For this purpose,
we use Kalman filtering to combine synthetic EEG data with a coupled
neural-mass model together with Ary's model of the head, which projects
intracranial signals onto the scalp. Our results show that using several
extracranial electrodes allows to successfully estimate the state and
parameters of the neural masses and their interactions, whereas one single
electrode provides only a very partial and insufficient view of the system. The
superiority of using multiple extracranial electrodes over using only one, be
it intra- or extracranial, is shown over a wide variety of dynamical
behaviours. Our results show potential towards future clinical applications of
the method.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we describe our method for classification of brain magnetic
resonance (MR) images into different abnormalities and healthy classes based on
the deep neural network. We propose our method to detect high and low-grade
glioma, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer diseases as well as healthy cases.
Our network architecture has ten learning layers that include seven
convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. We have achieved a
promising result in five categories of brain images (classification task) with
95.7% accuracy.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Anti-Epileptic Ketogenic Diet Alters Hippocampal Transporter Levels and Reduces Adiposity in Aged Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/178319v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Nutritional ketosis is induced by high fat/low carbohydrate dietary regimens, which produce high levels of circulating ketone bodies, shifting metabolism away from glucose utilization. While ketogenic diets (KD) were initially introduced to suppress seizures, they are garnering attention for their potential to treat a myriad of neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders that are associated with advanced age. The feasibility and physiological impact of implementing a long-term KD in old animals, however, has not been systematically examined. In this study, young and aged rats consumed a calorically- and nutritionally-matched KD or control diet for 12 weeks. All KD-fed rats maintained higher levels of {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and lower levels of glucose relative to controls. However, it took the aged rats longer to reach asymptotic levels of BHB compared to young animals. Moreover, KD-fed rats had significantly less visceral white and brown adipose tissue than controls without a loss of lean mass. Interestingly, the KD lead to significant alterations in protein levels of hippocampal transporters for monocarboxylates, glucose and vesicular glutamate and GABA. Most notably, the age-related decline in vesicular glutamate transporter expression was reversed by the KD. These data demonstrate the feasibility and potential benefits of KDs for treating age-associated neural dysfunction.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Systemic HIV-1 Infection Produces a Unique Glial Footprint in Humanized Mouse Brains</title>

	<description>Studies of innate glial cell responses for progressive human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) infection are hindered by the availability of relevant small-animal models. To overcome this hindrance, a mouse model reconstituted with humanized brain and immune systems was created. Newborn NOD/SCID/IL2R{gamma}c-/- mice of both sexes were transplanted with human neuroglial progenitors (NPC) and hematopoietic stem cells. Intraventricular injection of NPC yielded an anatomical symmetrical glia (human astrocyte and oligodendrocyte) repopulation of the mouse brain. The human glia were observed in periventricular areas, white matter tracts, the olfactory bulb and brain stem. HIV-1 infection of these dual humanized mice led to meningeal and perivascular human leukocyte infiltration into brain. The species-specific viral-neuroimmune interactions in the infected animals were identified by deep RNA sequencing. In the corpus callosum and hippocampus overlapping human-specific transcriptional alterations were seen for interferon type 1 and 2 signaling pathways (STAT1, 2, IRF9, ISG15, IFI6) and a range of host antiviral responses (MX1, OAS1, RSAD2, BST2, SAMHD1) in infected animals. Glial cytoskeleton reorganization, oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin ensheathment (MBP, MOBP, PLP1, MAG and ZNF488) were downregulated. The data sets were confirmed by real-time PCR. The viral defense signaling patterns observed in these mice parallels the neuroimmune communication networks present in the HIV-1 infected human brain. In this manner, the new mouse model can facilitate discovery of therapeutics, viral eradication targets for virus induced nervous system diseases, and simplify HIVCure research approaches.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Oxytocin Signaling in the Medial Amygdala is required for Sex Discrimination of Social Cues</title>

	<description>The neural control of social behaviors in rodents requires the encoding of pheromonal cues by the vomeronasal system. Here we show that the typical preference of male mice for females is eliminated in mutants lacking oxytocin, a neuropeptide modulating social behaviors in many species. Ablation of the oxytocin receptor in aromatase expressing neurons of the medial amygdala (MeA) fully recapitulates the elimination of female preference in males. Further, single unit recording in the MeA uncovered significant changes in the sensory representation of conspecific cues in the absence of oxytocin signaling. Finally, acute manipulation of oxytocin signaling in adults is sufficient to alter social interaction preferences in males as well as responses of MeA neurons to chemosensory cues. These results uncover the critical role of oxytocin signaling in a molecularly defined neuronal population in order to modulate the behavioral and physiological responses of male mice to females on a moment-to-moment basis.</description>

Granulomas are complex lung lesions that are the hallmark of tuberculosis (TB). Understanding antibiotic dynamics within lung granulomas will be vital to improving and shortening the long course of TB treatment. Three fluoroquinolones (FQs) are commonly prescribed as part of multi-drug resistant TB therapy: moxifloxacin (MXF), levofloxacin (LVX) or gatifloxacin (GFX). To date, insufficient data are available to support selection of one FQ over another, or to show that these drugs are clinically equivalent. To predict the efficacy of MXF, LVX and GFX at a single granuloma level, we integrate computational modeling with experimental datasets into a single mechanistic framework, &lt;i&gt;GranSim&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;GranSim&lt;/i&gt; is a hybrid agent-based computational model that simulates granuloma formation and function, FQ plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and is based on extensive &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data. We treat &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; granulomas with recommended daily doses of each FQ and compare efficacy by multiple metrics: bacterial load, sterilization rates, early bactericidal activity and efficacy under non-compliance and treatment interruption. &lt;i&gt;GranSim&lt;/i&gt; reproduces &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; plasma pharmacokinetics, spatial and temporal tissue pharmacokinetics and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; pharmacodynamics of these FQs. We predict that MXF kills intracellular bacteria more quickly than LVX and GFX due in part to a higher cellular accumulation ratio. We also show that all three FQs struggle to sterilize non-replicating bacteria residing in caseum. This is due to modest drug concentrations inside caseum and high inhibitory concentrations for this bacterial subpopulation. MXF and LVX have higher granuloma sterilization rates compared to GFX; and MXF performs better in a simulated non-compliance or treatment interruption scenario. We conclude that MXF has a small but potentially clinically significant advantage over LVX, as well as LVX over GFX. We illustrate how a systems pharmacology approach combining experimental and computational methods can guide antibiotic selection for TB.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2_HiujLsGu4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An optimal strategy for epilepsy surgery: Disruption of the rich-club?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005637</guid>

Surgery is a therapeutic option for people with epilepsy whose seizures are not controlled by anti-epilepsy drugs. In pre-surgical planning, an array of data modalities, often including intra-cranial EEG, is used in an attempt to map regions of the brain thought to be crucial for the generation of seizures. These regions are then resected with the hope that the individual is rendered seizure free as a consequence. However, post-operative seizure freedom is currently sub-optimal, suggesting that the pre-surgical assessment may be improved by taking advantage of a mechanistic understanding of seizure generation in large brain networks. Herein we use mathematical models to uncover the relative contribution of regions of the brain to seizure generation and consequently which brain regions should be considered for resection. A critical advantage of this modeling approach is that the effect of different surgical strategies can be predicted and quantitatively compared in advance of surgery. Herein we seek to understand seizure generation in networks with different topologies and study how the removal of different nodes in these networks reduces the occurrence of seizures. Since this a computationally demanding problem, a first step for this aim is to facilitate tractability of this approach for large networks. To do this, we demonstrate that predictions arising from a neural mass model are preserved in a lower dimensional, canonical model that is quicker to simulate. We then use this simpler model to study the emergence of seizures in artificial networks with different topologies, and calculate which nodes should be removed to render the network seizure free. We find that for scale-free and rich-club networks there exist specific nodes that are critical for seizure generation and should therefore be removed, whereas for small-world networks the strategy should instead focus on removing sufficient brain tissue. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by analysing intra-cranial EEG recordings from a database comprising 16 patients who have undergone epilepsy surgery, revealing rich-club structures within the obtained functional networks. We show that the postsurgical outcome for these patients was better when a greater proportion of the rich club was removed, in agreement with our theoretical predictions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TavGCoyBLyI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Modeling correlated noise is necessary to decode uncertainty. (arXiv:1708.04860v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04860</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04860</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain decoding algorithms form an important part of the arsenal of analysis
tools available to neuroscientists, allowing for a more detailed study of the
kind of information represented in patterns of cortical activity. While most
current decoding algorithms focus on estimating a single, most likely stimulus
from the pattern of noisy fMRI responses, the presence of noise causes this
estimate to be uncertain. This uncertainty in stimulus estimates is a
potentially highly relevant aspect of cortical stimulus processing, and
features prominently in Bayesian or probabilistic models of neural coding.
Here, we focus on sensory uncertainty and how best to extract this information
with fMRI. We first demonstrate in simulations that decoding algorithms that
take into account correlated noise between fMRI voxels better recover the
amount of uncertainty (quantified as the width of a probability distribution
over possible stimuli) associated with the decoded estimate. Furthermore, we
show that not all correlated variability should be treated equally, as modeling
tuning-dependent correlations has the greatest impact on decoding performance.
Next, we examine actual noise correlations in human visual cortex, and find
that shared variability in areas V1-V3 depends on the tuning properties of fMRI
voxels. In line with our simulations, accounting for this shared noise between
similarly tuned voxels produces important benefits in decoding. Our findings
underscore the importance of accurate noise models in fMRI decoding approaches,
and suggest a statistically feasible method to incorporate the most relevant
forms of shared noise.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Guiding Network Analysis using Graph Slepians: An Illustration for the C. Elegans Connectome. (arXiv:1708.04657v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04657</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04657</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spectral approaches of network analysis heavily rely upon the
eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian. For instance, in graph signal
processing, the Laplacian eigendecomposition is used to define the graph
Fourier transform and then transpose signal processing operations to graphs by
implementing them in the spectral domain. Here, we build on recent work that
generalized Slepian functions to the graph setting. In particular, graph
Slepians are band-limited graph signals with maximal energy concentration in a
given subgraph. We show how this approach can be used to guide network
analysis; i.e., we propose a visualization that reveals network organization of
a subgraph, but while striking a balance with global network structure. These
developments are illustrated for the structural connectome of the C. Elegans.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Switch-Independent Task Representations in Frontal and Parietal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/8033?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/8033?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alternating between two tasks is effortful and impairs performance. Previous fMRI studies have found increased activity in frontoparietal cortex when task switching is required. One possibility is that the additional control demands for switch trials are met by strengthening task representations in the human brain. Alternatively, on switch trials, the residual representation of the previous task might impede the buildup of a neural task representation. This would predict weaker task representations on switch trials, thus also explaining the performance costs. To test this, male and female participants were cued to perform one of two similar tasks, with the task being repeated or switched between successive trials. Multivoxel pattern analysis was used to test which regions encode the tasks and whether this encoding differs between switch and repeat trials. As expected, we found information about task representations in frontal and parietal cortex, but there was no difference in the decoding accuracy of task-related information between switch and repeat trials. Using cross-classification, we found that the frontoparietal cortex encodes tasks using a generalizable spatial pattern in switch and repeat trials. Therefore, task representations in frontal and parietal cortex are largely switch independent. We found no evidence that neural information about task representations in these regions can explain behavioral costs usually associated with task switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Alternating between two tasks is effortful and slows down performance. One possible explanation is that the representations in the human brain need time to build up and are thus weaker on switch trials, explaining performance costs. Alternatively, task representations might even be enhanced to overcome the previous task. Here, we used a combination of fMRI and a brain classifier to test whether the additional control demands under switching conditions lead to an increased or decreased strength of task representations in frontoparietal brain regions. We found that task representations are not modulated significantly by switching processes and generalize across switching conditions. Therefore, task representations in the human brain cannot account for the performance costs associated with alternating between tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Columnar Segregation of Magnocellular and Parvocellular Streams in Human Extrastriate Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/8014?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/8014?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnocellular versus parvocellular (M-P) streams are fundamental to the organization of macaque visual cortex. Segregated, paired M-P streams extend from retina through LGN into V1. The M stream extends further into area V5/MT, and parts of V2. However, elsewhere in visual cortex, it remains unclear whether M-P-derived information (1) becomes intermixed or (2) remains segregated in M-P-dominated columns and neurons. Here we tested whether M-P streams exist in extrastriate cortical columns, in 8 human subjects (4 female). We acquired high-resolution fMRI at high field (7T), testing for M- and P-influenced columns within each of four cortical areas (V2, V3, V3A, and V4), based on known functional distinctions in M-P streams in macaque: (1) color versus luminance, (2) binocular disparity, (3) luminance contrast sensitivity, (4) peak spatial frequency, and (5) color/spatial interactions. Additional measurements of resting state activity (eyes closed) tested for segregated functional connections between these columns. We found M- and P-like functions and connections within and between segregated cortical columns in V2, V3, and (in most experiments) area V4. Area V3A was dominated by the M stream, without significant influence from the P stream. These results suggest that M-P streams exist, and extend through, specific columns in early/middle stages of human extrastriate cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The magnocellular and parvocellular (M-P) streams are fundamental components of primate visual cortical organization. These streams segregate both anatomical and functional properties in parallel, from retina through primary visual cortex. However, in most higher-order cortical sites, it is unknown whether such M-P streams exist and/or what form those streams would take. Moreover, it is unknown whether M-P streams exist in human cortex. Here, fMRI evidence measured at high field (7T) and high resolution revealed segregated M-P streams in four areas of human extrastriate cortex. These results suggest that M-P information is processed in segregated parallel channels throughout much of human visual cortex; the M-P streams are more than a convenient sorting property in earlier stages of the visual system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Electrophysiological Evidence That the Retrosplenial Cortex Displays a Strong and Specific Activation Phased with Hippocampal Theta during Paradoxical (REM) Sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/8003?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/8003?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is widely accepted that cortical neurons are similarly more activated during waking and paradoxical sleep (PS; aka REM) than during slow-wave sleep (SWS). However, we recently reported using Fos labeling that only a few limbic cortical structures including the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) contain a large number of neurons activated during PS hypersomnia. Our aim in the present study was to record local field potentials and unit activity from these two structures across all vigilance states in freely moving male rats to determine whether the RSC and the ACA are electrophysiologically specifically active during basal PS episodes. We found that theta power was significantly higher during PS than during active waking (aWK) similarly in the RSC and hippocampus (HPC) but not in ACA. Phase–amplitude coupling between HPC theta and gamma oscillations strongly and specifically increased in RSC during PS compared with aWK. It did not occur in ACA. Further, 68% and 43% of the units recorded in the RSC and ACA were significantly more active during PS than during aWK and SWS, respectively. In addition, neuronal discharge of RSC but not of ACA neurons increased just after the peak of hippocampal theta wave. Our results show for the first time that RSC neurons display enhanced spiking in synchrony with theta specifically during PS. We propose that activation of RSC neurons specifically during PS may play a role in the offline consolidation of spatial memories, and in the generation of vivid perceptual scenery during dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fifty years ago, Michel Jouvet used the term paradoxical to define REM sleep because of the simultaneous occurrence of a cortical activation similar to waking accompanied by muscle atonia. However, we recently demonstrated using functional neuroanatomy that only a few limbic structures including the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) are activated during PS. In the present study, we show for the first time that the RSC and ACA contain neurons firing more during PS than in any other state. Further, RSC neurons are firing in phase with the hippocampal theta rhythm. These data indicate that the RSC is very active during PS and could play a key role in memory consolidation taking place during this state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Trajectories of Cortisol Response to Prolonged Acute Stress Are Linked to Affective Responses and Hippocampal Gray Matter Volume in Healthy Females</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/7994?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The development of robust laboratory procedures for acute stress induction over the last decades has greatly advanced our understanding of stress responses in humans and their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Nevertheless, attempts to uncover linear relationships among endocrine, neural, and affective responses to stress have generally yielded inconsistent results. Here, 79 healthy females completed a well established laboratory procedure of acute stress induction that was modified to prolong its effect. Endocrinological and subjective affect assessments revealed stress-induced increases in cortisol release and negative affect that persisted 65 and 100 min after stress onset, respectively, confirming a relatively prolonged acute stress induction. Applying latent class linear mixed modeling on individuals' patterns of cortisol responses identified three distinct trajectories of cortisol response: the hyper-response (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10), moderate-response (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21), and mild-response (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 48) groups. Notably, whereas all three groups exhibited a significant stress-induced increase in cortisol release and negative affect, the hyper-response and mild-response groups both reported more negative affect relative to the moderate-response group. Structural MRI revealed no group differences in hippocampal and amygdala volumes, yet a continuous measure of cortisol response (area under the curve) showed that high and low levels of stress-induced cortisol release were associated with less hippocampal gray matter volume compared with moderate cortisol release. Together, these results suggest that distinct trajectories of cortisol response to prolonged acute stress among healthy females may not be captured by conventional linear analyses; instead, quadratic relations may better describe links between cortisol response to stress and affective responses, as well as hippocampal structural variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite substantial research, it is unclear whether and how individual neuroendocrine stress response patterns are linked to affective responses to stress and structural variability in neuroendocrine regulatory brain regions. By applying latent class linear mixed modeling on individuals' patterns of cortisol responses to a prolonged acute stressor, we identified three distinct trajectories of cortisol response. Relative to the group showing a moderate cortisol response, groups characterized by hyper and mild cortisol response were both associated with more negative affect. Moreover, a continuous measure of cortisol response showed that high and low levels of stress-induced cortisol release correlated with reduced hippocampal gray matter volume. Given that neuroendocrine stress responses are conceptualized as biomarkers of stress susceptibility, these insights may have clinical implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This will gradually close, giving rise to a healthy, spherical optic cup. Failure of the optic fissure to close gives rise to an ocular disorder known as coloboma. During this developmental process, &lt;i&gt;Foxg1&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in the optic neuroepithelium, with highest levels of expression in the nasal optic stalk. &lt;i&gt;Foxg1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mice have microphthalmic eyes with a large ventral coloboma. We found &lt;i&gt;Wnt8b&lt;/i&gt; expression upregulated in the &lt;i&gt;Foxg1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; optic stalk and hypothesized that, similar to what is observed in telencephalic development, Foxg1 directs development of the optic neuroepithelium through transcriptional suppression of &lt;i&gt;Wnt8b&lt;/i&gt;. To test this, we generated &lt;i&gt;Foxg1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;Wnt8b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; double mutants of either sex and found that the morphology of the optic cup and stalk and the closure of the optic fissure were substantially rescued in these embryos. This rescue correlates with restored Pax2 expression in the anterior tip of the optic fissure. In addition, although we do not find evidence implicating altered proliferation in the rescue, we observe a significant increase in apoptotic cell density in &lt;i&gt;Foxg1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;Wnt8b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; double mutants compared with the &lt;i&gt;Foxg1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; single mutant. Upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin target molecules in the optic cup and stalk may underlie the molecular and morphological defects in the &lt;i&gt;Foxg1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mutant. Our results show that proper optic fissure closure relies on &lt;i&gt;Wnt8b&lt;/i&gt; suppression by Foxg1 in the nasal optic stalk to maintain balanced apoptosis and Pax2 expression in the nasal and temporal edges of the fissure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Coloboma is an ocular disorder that may result in a loss of visual acuity and accounts for ~10% of childhood blindness. It results from errors in the sealing of the optic fissure (OF), a transient structure at the bottom of the eye. Here, we investigate the colobomatous phenotype of the &lt;i&gt;Foxg1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mouse. We identify upregulated expression of Wnt8b in the optic stalk of &lt;i&gt;Foxg1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mutants before OF closure initiates. &lt;i&gt;Foxg1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;Wnt8b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; double mutants show a substantial rescue of the &lt;i&gt;Foxg1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; coloboma phenotype, which correlates with a rescue in molecular and cellular defects of &lt;i&gt;Foxg1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mutants. Our results unravel a new role of Foxg1 in promoting OF closure providing additional knowledge about the molecules and cellular mechanisms underlying coloboma formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Gamma Oscillations in the Rat Ventral Striatum Originate in the Piriform Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/7962?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the human and rodent ventral striatum (vStr) exhibit prominent, behaviorally relevant gamma-band oscillations. These oscillations are related to local spiking activity and transiently synchronize with anatomically related areas, suggesting a possible role in organizing vStr activity. However, the origin of vStr gamma is unknown. We recorded vStr gamma oscillations across a 1.4 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; grid spanned by 64 recording electrodes as male rats rested and foraged for rewards, revealing a highly consistent power gradient originating in the adjacent piriform cortex. Phase differences across the vStr were consistently small (&amp;lt;15°) and current source density analysis further confirmed the absence of local sink-source pairs in the vStr. Reversible occlusions of the ipsilateral (but not contralateral) nostril, known to abolish gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex, strongly reduced vStr gamma power and the occurrence of transient gamma-band events. These results imply that local circuitry is not a major contributor to gamma oscillations in the vStr LFP and that piriform cortex is an important driver of gamma-band oscillations in the vStr and associated limbic areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ventral striatum (vStr) is an area of anatomical convergence in circuits underlying motivated behavior, but it remains unclear how its inputs from different sources interact. A major proposal about how neural circuits may switch dynamically between convergent inputs is through temporal organization reflected in local field potential (LFP) oscillations. Our results show that, in the rat, the mechanisms controlling gamma-band oscillations in the vStr LFP are primarily located in the in the adjacent piriform cortex rather than in the vStr itself, providing a novel interpretation of previous rodent work on gamma oscillations in the vStr and related circuits and an important consideration for future work seeking to use oscillations in these areas as biomarkers for behavioral and neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Disruption of a Structurally Important Extracellular Element in the Glycine Receptor Leads to Decreased Synaptic Integration and Signaling Resulting in Severe Startle Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/7948?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional impairments or trafficking defects of inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs) have been linked to human hyperekplexia/startle disease and autism spectrum disorders. We found that a lack of synaptic integration of GlyRs, together with disrupted receptor function, is responsible for a lethal startle phenotype in a novel spontaneous mouse mutant &lt;i&gt;shaky&lt;/i&gt;, caused by a missense mutation, Q177K, located in the extracellular β8–β9 loop of the GlyR α1 subunit. Recently, structural data provided evidence that the flexibility of the β8–β9 loop is crucial for conformational transitions during opening and closing of the ion channel and represents a novel allosteric binding site in Cys-loop receptors. We identified the underlying neuropathological mechanisms in male and female &lt;i&gt;shaky&lt;/i&gt; mice through a combination of protein biochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and in &lt;i&gt;vitro&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology. Increased expression of the mutant GlyR α1&lt;sup&gt;Q177K&lt;/sup&gt; subunit &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; was not sufficient to compensate for a decrease in synaptic integration of α1&lt;sup&gt;Q177K&lt;/sup&gt;β GlyRs. The remaining synaptic heteromeric α1&lt;sup&gt;Q177K&lt;/sup&gt;β GlyRs had decreased current amplitudes with significantly faster decay times. This functional disruption reveals an important role for the GlyR α1 subunit β8–β9 loop in initiating rearrangements within the extracellular–transmembrane GlyR interface and that this structural element is vital for inhibitory GlyR function, signaling, and synaptic clustering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; GlyR dysfunction underlies neuromotor deficits in startle disease and autism spectrum disorders. We describe an extracellular GlyR α1 subunit mutation (Q177K) in a novel mouse startle disease mutant &lt;i&gt;shaky&lt;/i&gt;. Structural data suggest that during signal transduction, large transitions of the β8–β9 loop occur in response to neurotransmitter binding. Disruption of the β8–β9 loop by the Q177K mutation results in a disruption of hydrogen bonds between Q177 and the ligand-binding residue R65. Functionally, the Q177K change resulted in decreased current amplitudes, altered desensitization decay time constants, and reduced GlyR clustering and synaptic strength. The GlyR β8–β9 loop is therefore an essential regulator of conformational rearrangements during ion channel opening and closing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Striatal GPR88 Modulates Foraging Efficiency</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/7939?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/7939?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The striatum is anatomically and behaviorally implicated in behaviors that promote efficient foraging. To investigate this function, we studied instrumental choice behavior in mice lacking GPR88, a striatum-enriched orphan G-protein-coupled receptor that modulates striatal medium spiny neuron excitability. Our results reveal that hungry mice lacking GPR88 (KO mice) were slow to acquire food-reinforced lever press but could lever press similar to controls on a progressive ratio schedule. Both WT and KO mice discriminated between reward and no-reward levers; however, KO mice failed to discriminate based on relative quantity-reward (1 vs 3 food pellets) or effort (3 vs 9 lever presses). We also demonstrate preference for the high-reward (3 pellet) lever was selectively reestablished when &lt;i&gt;GPR88&lt;/i&gt; expression was restored to the striatum. We propose that &lt;i&gt;GPR88&lt;/i&gt; expression within the striatum is integral to efficient action-selection during foraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Evolutionary pressure driving energy homeostasis favored detection and comparison of caloric value. In wild and laboratory settings, neural systems involved in energy homeostasis bias foraging to maximize energy efficiency. This is observed when foraging behaviors are guided by superior nutritional density or minimized caloric expenditure. The striatum is anatomically and functionally well placed to perform the sensory and motor integration necessary for efficient action selection during foraging. However, few studies have examined this behavioral phenomenon or elucidated underlying molecular mechanisms. Both humans and mice with nonfunctional GPR88 have been shown to present striatal dysfunctions and impaired learning. We demonstrate that GPR88 expression is necessary to efficiently integrate effort and energy density information guiding instrumental choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: {theta}-Band and {beta}-Band Neural Activity Reflects Independent Syllable Tracking and Comprehension of Time-Compressed Speech</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/7930?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/7930?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent psychophysics data suggest that speech perception is not limited by the capacity of the auditory system to encode fast acoustic variations through neural  activity, but rather by the time given to the brain to decode them. Whether the decoding process is bounded by the capacity of  rhythm to follow syllabic rhythms in speech, or constrained by a more endogenous top-down mechanism, e.g., involving β activity, is unknown. We addressed the dynamics of auditory decoding in speech comprehension by challenging syllable tracking and speech decoding using comprehensible and incomprehensible time-compressed auditory sentences. We recorded EEGs in human participants and found that neural activity in both  and  ranges was sensitive to syllabic rate. Phase patterns of slow neural activity consistently followed the syllabic rate (4–14 Hz), even when this rate went beyond the classical  range (4–8 Hz). The power of  activity increased linearly with syllabic rate but showed no sensitivity to comprehension. Conversely, the power of β (14–21 Hz) activity was insensitive to the syllabic rate, yet reflected comprehension on a single-trial basis. We found different long-range dynamics for  and β activity, with β activity building up in time while more contextual information becomes available. This is consistent with the roles of  and β activity in stimulus-driven versus endogenous mechanisms. These data show that speech comprehension is constrained by concurrent stimulus-driven  and low- activity, and by endogenous β activity, but not primarily by the capacity of  activity to track the syllabic rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Speech comprehension partly depends on the ability of the auditory cortex to track syllable boundaries with -range neural oscillations. The reason comprehension drops when speech is accelerated could hence be because  oscillations can no longer follow the syllabic rate. Here, we presented subjects with comprehensible and incomprehensible accelerated speech, and show that neural phase patterns in the  band consistently reflect the syllabic rate, even when speech becomes too fast to be intelligible. The drop in comprehension, however, is signaled by a significant decrease in the power of low-β oscillations (14–21 Hz). These data suggest that speech comprehension is not limited by the capacity of  oscillations to adapt to syllabic rate, but by an endogenous decoding process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Preferential Disruption of Prefrontal GABAergic Function by Nanomolar Concentrations of the {alpha}7nACh Negative Modulator Kynurenic Acid</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/7921?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increased concentrations of kynurenic acid (KYNA) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are thought to contribute to the development of cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia. Although this view is consistent with preclinical studies showing a negative impact of prefrontal KYNA elevation on executive function, the mechanism underlying such a disruption remains unclear. Here, we measured changes in local field potential (LFP) responses to ventral hippocampal stimulation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in brain slices to reveal how nanomolar concentrations of KYNA alter synaptic transmission in the PFC of male adult rats. Our data show that prefrontal infusions of KYNA attenuated the inhibitory component of PFC LFP responses, a disruption that resulted from local blockade of α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChR). At the cellular level, we found that the inhibitory action exerted by KYNA in the PFC occurred primarily at local GABAergic synapses through an α7nAChR-dependent presynaptic mechanism. As a result, the excitatory–inhibitory ratio of synaptic transmission becomes imbalanced in a manner that correlates highly with the level of GABAergic suppression by KYNA. Finally, prefrontal infusion of a GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R positive allosteric modulator was sufficient to overcome the disrupting effect of KYNA and normalized the pattern of LFP inhibition in the PFC. Thus, the preferential inhibitory effect of KYNA on prefrontal GABAergic transmission could contribute to the onset of cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia because proper GABAergic control of PFC output is one key mechanism for supporting such cortical functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Brain kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an astrocyte-derived metabolite and its abnormal elevation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to impair cognitive functions in individuals with schizophrenia. However, the mechanism underlying the disrupting effect of KYNA remains unclear. Here we found that KYNA biases the excitatory–inhibitory balance of prefrontal synaptic activity toward a state of disinhibition. Such disruption emerges as a result of a preferential suppression of local GABAergic transmission by KYNA via presynaptic inhibition of α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling. Therefore, the degree of GABAergic dysregulation in the PFC could be a clinically relevant contributing factor for the onset of cognitive deficits resulting from abnormal increases of cortical KYNA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Tuning to Low-Level Features of Speech throughout the Perisylvian Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/7906?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/7906?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite a large body of research, we continue to lack a detailed account of how auditory processing of continuous speech unfolds in the human brain. Previous research showed the propagation of low-level acoustic features of speech from posterior superior temporal gyrus toward anterior superior temporal gyrus in the human brain (Hullett et al., 2016). In this study, we investigate what happens to these neural representations past the superior temporal gyrus and how they engage higher-level language processing areas such as inferior frontal gyrus. We used low-level sound features to model neural responses to speech outside of the primary auditory cortex. Two complementary imaging techniques were used with human participants (both males and females): electrocorticography (ECoG) and fMRI. Both imaging techniques showed tuning of the perisylvian cortex to low-level speech features. With ECoG, we found evidence of propagation of the temporal features of speech sounds along the ventral pathway of language processing in the brain toward inferior frontal gyrus. Increasingly coarse temporal features of speech spreading from posterior superior temporal cortex toward inferior frontal gyrus were associated with linguistic features such as voice onset time, duration of the formant transitions, and phoneme, syllable, and word boundaries. The present findings provide the groundwork for a comprehensive bottom-up account of speech comprehension in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We know that, during natural speech comprehension, a broad network of perisylvian cortical regions is involved in sound and language processing. Here, we investigated the tuning to low-level sound features within these regions using neural responses to a short feature film. We also looked at whether the tuning organization along these brain regions showed any parallel to the hierarchy of language structures in continuous speech. Our results show that low-level speech features propagate throughout the perisylvian cortex and potentially contribute to the emergence of &quot;coarse&quot; speech representations in inferior frontal gyrus typically associated with high-level language processing. These findings add to the previous work on auditory processing and underline a distinctive role of inferior frontal gyrus in natural speech comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hierarchically Organized Medial Frontal Cortex-Basal Ganglia Loops Selectively Control Task- and Response-Selection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/7893?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adaptive behavior requires context-sensitive configuration of task-sets that specify time-varying stimulus–response mappings. Intriguingly, response time costs associated with changing task-sets and motor responses are known to be strongly interactive: switch costs at the task level are small in the presence of a response-switch but large when accompanied by a response-repetition, and vice versa for response-switch costs. The reasons behind this well known interdependence between task- and response-level control processes are currently not well understood. Here, we formalized and tested a model assuming a hierarchical organization of superordinate task-set and subordinate response-set selection processes to account for this effect. The model was found to successfully explain the full range of behavioral task- and response-switch costs across first and second order trial transitions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy humans, we then characterized the neural circuitry mediating these effects. We found that presupplementary motor area (preSMA) activity tracked task-set control costs, SMA activity tracked response-set control costs, and basal ganglia (BG) activity mirrored the interaction between task- and response-set regulation processes that characterized participants' response times. A subsequent fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation experiment confirmed dissociable roles of the preSMA and SMA in determining response costs. Together, these data provide evidence for a hierarchical organization of posterior medial frontal cortex and its interaction with the BG, where a superordinate preSMA-BG loop establishes task-set selection, which imposes a (unidirectional) constraint on a subordinate SMA-BG loop that determines response-selection, resulting in the characteristic interdependence in task- and response-switch costs in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ability to use context-sensitive task-sets to guide our responses is central to human adaptive behavior. Task and response selection are strongly interactive: it is more difficult to repeat a response in the context of a changing task-set, and vice versa. However, the neurocognitive architecture giving rise to this interdependence is currently not understood. Here we use modeling, neuroimaging, and noninvasive neurostimulation to show that this phenomenon derives from a hierarchical organization of posterior medial frontal cortex and its interaction with the basal ganglia, where a more anterior corticostriatal loop establishes task-set selection, which constrains a more posterior loop responsible for response-selection. These data provide a neural explanation for a key behavioral signature of human cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Chemokine CCL2-CCR2 Signaling Induces Neuronal Cell Death via STAT3 Activation and IL-1{beta} Production after Status Epilepticus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Elevated levels of chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and its receptor CCR2 have been reported in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and in experimental seizures. However, the functional significance and molecular mechanism underlying CCL2–CCR2 signaling in epileptic brain remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that the upregulated CCL2 was mainly expressed in hippocampal neurons and activated microglia from mice 1 d after kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures. Taking advantage of &lt;i&gt;CX3CR1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;GFP&lt;/i&gt;/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;:CCR2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;RFP&lt;/i&gt;/+&lt;/sup&gt; double-transgenic mice, we demonstrated that CCL2–CCR2 signaling has a role in resident microglial activation and blood-derived monocyte infiltration. Moreover, seizure-induced degeneration of neurons in the hippocampal CA3 region was attenuated in mice lacking CCL2 or CCR2. We further showed that CCR2 activation induced STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) phosphorylation and IL-1β production, which are critical for promoting neuronal cell death after status epilepticus. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 by WP1066 reduced seizure-induced IL-1β production and subsequent neuronal death. Two weeks after KA-induced seizures, CCR2 deficiency not only reduced neuronal loss, but also attenuated seizure-induced behavioral impairments, including anxiety, memory decline, and recurrent seizure severity. Together, we demonstrated that CCL2–CCR2 signaling contributes to neurodegeneration via STAT3 activation and IL-1β production after status epilepticus, providing potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Epilepsy is a global concern and epileptic seizures occur in many neurological conditions. Neuroinflammation associated with microglial activation and monocyte infiltration are characteristic of epileptic brains. However, molecular mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation in neuronal death following epilepsy remain to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that CCL2–CCR2 signaling is required for monocyte infiltration, which in turn contributes to kainic acid (KA)-induced neuronal cell death. The downstream of CCR2 activation involves STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) phosphorylation and IL-1β production. Two weeks after KA-induced seizures, CCR2 deficiency not only reduced neuronal loss, but also attenuated seizure-induced behavioral impairments, including anxiety, memory decline, and recurrent seizure severity. The current study provides a novel insight on the function and mechanisms of CCL2–CCR2 signaling in KA-induced neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Interleukin-1 Receptor in Seizure Susceptibility after Traumatic Injury to the Pediatric Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy after pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with poor quality of life. This study aimed to characterize post-traumatic epilepsy in a mouse model of pediatric brain injury, and to evaluate the role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling as a target for pharmacological intervention. Male mice received a controlled cortical impact or sham surgery at postnatal day 21, approximating a toddler-aged child. Mice were treated acutely with an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra; 100 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle. Spontaneous and evoked seizures were evaluated from video-EEG recordings. Behavioral assays tested for functional outcomes, postmortem analyses assessed neuropathology, and brain atrophy was detected by &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; magnetic resonance imaging. At 2 weeks and 3 months post-injury, TBI mice showed an elevated seizure response to the convulsant pentylenetetrazol compared with sham mice, associated with abnormal hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting. A robust increase in IL-1β and IL-1 receptor were detected after TBI. IL-1Ra treatment reduced seizure susceptibility 2 weeks after TBI compared with vehicle, and a reduction in hippocampal astrogliosis. In a chronic study, IL-1Ra-TBI mice showed improved spatial memory at 4 months post-injury. At 5 months, most TBI mice exhibited spontaneous seizures during a 7 d video-EEG recording period. At 6 months, IL-1Ra-TBI mice had fewer evoked seizures compared with vehicle controls, coinciding with greater preservation of cortical tissue. Findings demonstrate this model's utility to delineate mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis after pediatric brain injury, and provide evidence of IL-1 signaling as a mediator of post-traumatic astrogliosis and seizure susceptibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Epilepsy is a common cause of morbidity after traumatic brain injury in early childhood. However, a limited understanding of how epilepsy develops, particularly in the immature brain, likely contributes to the lack of efficacious treatments. In this preclinical study, we first demonstrate that a mouse model of traumatic injury to the pediatric brain reproduces many neuropathological and seizure-like hallmarks characteristic of epilepsy. Second, we demonstrate that targeting the acute inflammatory response reduces cognitive impairments, the degree of neuropathology, and seizure susceptibility, after pediatric brain injury in mice. These findings provide evidence that inflammatory cytokine signaling is a key process underlying epilepsy development after an acquired brain insult, which represents a feasible therapeutic target to improve quality of life for survivors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;RAB3A-interacting molecule (RIM) proteins are important regulators of transmitter release from active zones. At conventional chemical synapses, RIMs contribute substantially to vesicle priming and docking and their loss reduces the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles by up to 75%. The priming function of RIMs is mediated via the formation of a tripartite complex with Munc13 and RAB3A, which brings synaptic vesicles in close proximity to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and the fusion site and activates Munc13. We reported previously that, at mouse photoreceptor ribbon synapses, vesicle priming is Munc13 independent. In this study, we examined RIM expression, distribution, and function at male and female mouse photoreceptor ribbon synapses. We provide evidence that RIM1α and RIM1β are highly likely absent from mouse photoreceptors and that RIM2α is the major large RIM isoform present at photoreceptor ribbon synapses. We show that mouse photoreceptors predominantly express RIM2 variants that lack the interaction domain for Munc13. Loss of full-length RIM2α in a RIM2α mutant mouse only marginally perturbs photoreceptor synaptic transmission. Our findings therefore strongly argue for a priming mechanism at the photoreceptor ribbon synapse that is independent of the formation of a RIM–Munc13–RAB3A complex and thus provide further evidence for a fundamental difference between photoreceptor ribbon synapses and conventional chemical synapses in synaptic vesicle exocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; RAB3A-interacting molecules 1 and 2 (RIM1/2) are essential regulators of exocytosis. At conventional chemical synapses, their function involves Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel clustering and synaptic vesicle priming and docking through interactions with Munc13 and RAB3A, respectively. Examining wild-type and RIM2 mutant mice, we show here that the sensory photoreceptor ribbon synapses most likely lack RIM1 and predominantly express RIM2 variants that lack the interaction domain for Munc13. Our findings demonstrate that the photoreceptor-specific RIM variants are not essential for synaptic vesicle priming at photoreceptor ribbon synapses, which represents a fundamental difference between photoreceptor ribbon synapses and conventional chemical synapses with respect to synaptic vesicle priming mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A GluN2B-Selective NMDAR Antagonist Reverses Synapse Loss and Cognitive Impairment Produced by the HIV-1 Protein Tat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/7837?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) affects approximately half of HIV-infected patients. Loss of synaptic connections is a hallmark of many neurocognitive disorders, including HAND. The HIV-1 protein transactivator of transcription (Tat) disrupts synaptic connections both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and has been linked to impaired neurocognitive function in humans. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies have shown that ifenprodil, an antagonist selective for GluN2B-containing NMDARs, reverses synapse loss when applied after Tat. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Tat-induced loss and ifenprodil-mediated rescue of synaptic spines &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; would predict impairment and rescue of cognitive function. Using intracranial multiphoton imaging, we found that infusion of 100 ng of HIV-1 Tat into the lateral ventricle of yellow fluorescent protein-expressing transgenic mice produced a 17 ± 1% loss of dendritic spines in layer 1 of retrosplenial cortex. Repeated imaging of the same dendrites over 3 weeks enabled longitudinal experiments that demonstrated sustained spine loss after Tat infusion and transient rescue after ifenprodil administration (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Parallel trace fear conditioning experiments showed that spine loss predicted learning deficits and that the time course of ifenprodil-induced rescue of spine density correlated with restoration of cognitive function. These results show for the first time that, during exposure to an HIV-1 neurotoxin &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, alteration of GluN2B-containing NMDAR signaling suppresses spine density and impairs learning. Pharmacological inhibition of these NMDARs rescued spines and restored cognitive function. Drugs that rescue synapses may improve neurocognitive function in HAND.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptodendritic damage correlates with cognitive decline in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) patients. We developed an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging approach for longitudinal tracking of spine density that enabled correlation of synaptic changes with behavioral outcomes in a model of HAND. We show for the first time that spine loss after exposure to an HIV-1 protein can be reversed pharmacologically and that loss and recovery of dendritic spines predict impairment and restoration of cognitive function, respectively. Therefore, synapse loss, the hallmark of cognitive decline in HAND, is reversible. Drugs that restore spine density may have broad application for improving cognitive function during the early phases of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Delayed Cryptochrome Degradation Asymmetrically Alters the Daily Rhythm in Suprachiasmatic Clock Neuron Excitability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/33/7824?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) neurons contain an intracellular molecular circadian clock and the Cryptochromes (CRY1/2), key transcriptional repressors of this molecular apparatus, are subject to post-translational modification through ubiquitination and targeting for proteosomal degradation by the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. Loss-of-function point mutations in a component of this ligase complex, Fbxl3, delay CRY1/2 degradation, reduce circadian rhythm strength, and lengthen the circadian period by ~2.5 h. The molecular clock drives circadian changes in the membrane properties of SCN neurons, but it is unclear how alterations in CRY1/2 stability affect SCN neurophysiology. Here we use male and female &lt;i&gt;Afterhours&lt;/i&gt; mice which carry the circadian period lengthening loss-of-function &lt;i&gt;Fbxl3&lt;sup&gt;Afh&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mutation and perform patch-clamp recordings from SCN brain slices across the projected day/night cycle. We find that the daily rhythm in membrane excitability in the ventral SCN (vSCN) was enhanced in amplitude and delayed in timing in &lt;i&gt;Fbxl3&lt;sup&gt;Afh/Afh&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. At night, vSCN cells from &lt;i&gt;Fbxl3&lt;sup&gt;Afh/Afh&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice were more hyperpolarized, receiving more GABAergic input than their &lt;i&gt;Fbxl3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; counterparts. Unexpectedly, the progression to daytime hyperexcited states was slowed by &lt;i&gt;Afh&lt;/i&gt; mutation, whereas the decline to hypoexcited states was accelerated. In long-term bioluminescence recordings, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor blockade desynchronized the &lt;i&gt;Fbxl3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; but not the &lt;i&gt;Fbxl3&lt;sup&gt;Afh/Afh&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; vSCN neuronal network. Further, a neurochemical mimic of the light input pathway evoked larger shifts in molecular clock rhythms in &lt;i&gt;Fbxl3&lt;sup&gt;Afh/Afh&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; compared with &lt;i&gt;Fbxl3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; SCN slices. These results reveal unanticipated consequences of delaying CRY degradation, indicating that the &lt;i&gt;Afh&lt;/i&gt; mutation prolongs nighttime hyperpolarized states of vSCN cells through increased GABAergic synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The intracellular molecular clock drives changes in SCN neuronal excitability, but it is unclear how mutations affecting post-translational modification of molecular clock proteins influence the temporal expression of SCN neuronal state or intercellular communication within the SCN network. Here we show for the first time, that a mutation that prolongs the stability of key components of the intracellular clock, the cryptochrome proteins, unexpectedly increases in the expression of hypoexcited neuronal state in the ventral SCN at night and enhances hyperpolarization of ventral SCN neurons at this time. This is accompanied by increased GABAergic signaling and by enhanced responsiveness to a neurochemical mimic of the light input pathway to the SCN. Therefore, post-translational modification shapes SCN neuronal state and network properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effect of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity on Stochastic Burst Synchronization in A Scale-Free Neuronal Network. (arXiv:1708.04543v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04543</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04543</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider an excitatory population of subthreshold Izhikevich neurons which
cannot fire spontaneously without noise. As the coupling strength passes a
threshold, individual neurons exhibit noise-induced burstings. This neuronal
population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In the absence of STDP, stochastic
burst synchronization (SBS) between noise-induced burstings of subthreshold
neurons was previously found to occur over a large range of intermediate noise
intensities. Here, we study the effect of additive STDP on the SBS by varying
the noise intensity $D$ in the Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free network (SFN) for
the case of symmetric preferential attachment. This type of SFN exhibits a
power-law degree distribution, and hence it becomes an inhomogeneous one with a
few &quot;hubs&quot; (i.e., super-connected nodes). Occurrence of a &quot;Matthew&quot; effect in
synaptic plasticity is found to occur due to a positive feedback process. Good
burst synchronization gets better via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic
strengths, while bad burst synchronization gets worse via long-term depression
(LTD). Consequently, a step-like rapid transition to SBS occurs by changing
$D$, in contrast to a relatively smooth transition in the absence of STDP. In
the presence of additive STDP, we also investigate the effects of network
architecture on the SBS for a fixed $D$. Emergences of LTP and LTD of synaptic
strengths are investigated in details via microscopic studies based on both the
distributions of time delays between the burst onset times of the pre- and the
post-synaptic neurons and the pair-correlations between the pre- and the
post-synaptic IIBRs (instantaneous individual burst rates). Finally, a
multiplicative STDP case (depending on states) is also investigated in
comparison with the additive STDP case (independent of states).

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04392</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;While information processing in complex systems can be described in abstract,
general terms, there are cases in which the relation between these computations
and the physical substrate of the underlying system is itself of interest.
Prominently, the brain is one such case. With the aim of relating information
and dynamics in biological neural systems, we study a model network of spiking
neurons with different coupling configurations, and explore the relation
between its informational, dynamical, and topological properties. We find that
information transfer and storage peak at two separate points for different
values of the coupling parameter, and are balanced at an intermediate point. In
this configuration, avalanches in the network follow a long-tailed, power
law-like distribution. Furthermore, the avalanche statistics at this point
reproduce empirical findings in the biological brain.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this study is to extract a set of brain networks in multiple
time-resolutions to analyze the connectivity patterns among the anatomic
regions for a given cognitive task. We suggest a deep architecture which learns
the natural groupings of the connectivity patterns of human brain in multiple
time-resolutions. The suggested architecture is tested on task data set of
Human Connectome Project (HCP) where we extract multi-resolution networks, each
of which corresponds to a cognitive task. At the first level of this
architecture, we decompose the fMRI signal into multiple sub-bands using
wavelet decompositions. At the second level, for each sub-band, we estimate a
brain network extracted from short time windows of the fMRI signal. At the
third level, we feed the adjacency matrices of each mesh network at each
time-resolution into an unsupervised deep learning algorithm, namely, a Stacked
De- noising Auto-Encoder (SDAE). The outputs of the SDAE provide a compact
connectivity representation for each time window at each sub-band of the fMRI
signal. We concatenate the learned representations of all sub-bands at each
window and cluster them by a hierarchical algorithm to find the natural
groupings among the windows. We observe that each cluster represents a
cognitive task with a performance of 93% Rand Index and 71% Adjusted Rand
Index. We visualize the mean values and the precisions of the networks at each
component of the cluster mixture. The mean brain networks at cluster centers
show the variations among cognitive tasks and the precision of each cluster
shows the within cluster variability of networks, across the subjects.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00509</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal models based on the Hodgkin-Huxley equation form a fundamental
framework in the field of computational neuroscience. While the neuronal state
is often modeled deterministically, experimental recordings show stochastic
fluctuations, presumably driven by molecular noise from the underlying
microphysical conditions. In turn, the firing of individual neurons gives rise
to an electric field n extracellular space, also thought to affect the firing
pattern of nearby neurons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We develop a multiscale model which combines a stochastic ion channel gating
process taking place on the neuronal membrane, together with the propagation of
an action potential along the neuronal structure. We also devise a numerical
method relying on a split-step strategy which effectively couples these two
processes and we experimentally test the feasibility of this approach. We
finally also explain how the approach can be extended with Maxwell's equations
to allow the potential to be propagated in extracellular space.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans can effortlessly recognize others' actions in the presence of complex
transformations, such as changes in viewpoint. Several studies have located the
regions in the brain involved in invariant action recognition, however, the
underlying neural computations remain poorly understood. We use
magnetoencephalography (MEG) decoding and a dataset of well-controlled,
naturalistic videos of five actions (run, walk, jump, eat, drink) performed by
different actors at different viewpoints to study the computational steps used
to recognize actions across complex transformations. In particular, we ask when
the brain discounts changes in 3D viewpoint relative to when it initially
discriminates between actions. We measure the latency difference between
invariant and non-invariant action decoding when subjects view full videos as
well as form-depleted and motion-depleted stimuli. Our results show no
difference in decoding latency or temporal profile between invariant and
non-invariant action recognition in full videos. However, when either form or
motion information is removed from the stimulus set, we observe a decrease and
delay in invariant action decoding. Our results suggest that the brain
recognizes actions and builds invariance to complex transformations at the same
time, and that both form and motion information are crucial for fast, invariant
action recognition.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As a promising computational paradigm, occurrence of critical states in
artificial and biological neural networks has attracted wide-spread attention.
An often-made explicit or implicit assumption is that one single critical state
is responsible for two separate notions of criticality (avalanche criticality
and dynamical edge of chaos criticality). Previously, we provided an isolated
counter-example for co-occurrence. Here, we reveal a persistent paradigm of
structural transitions that such networks undergo, as the overall connectivity
strength is varied over its biologically meaningful range. Among these
transitions, only one avalanche critical point emerges, with edge of chaos
failing to co-occur. Our observations are based on ensembles of networks
obtained from variations of network configuration and their neurons. This
suggests that not only non-coincidence of criticality, but also the persistent
paradigm of network structural changes in function of the overall connectivity
strength, could be generic features of a large class of biological neural
networks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the past two decades, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging has been used
to relate neuronal network activity to cognitive processing and behaviour.
Recently this approach has been augmented by algorithms that allow us to infer
causal links between component populations of neuronal networks. Multiple
inference procedures have been proposed to approach this research question but
so far, each method has limitations when it comes to establishing whole-brain
connectivity patterns. In this paper, we discuss the ways to infer causality in
fMRI research. We also formulate recommendations for the future directions in
this area.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantifying multivariate redundancy with maximum entropy decompositions of mutual information. (arXiv:1708.03845v1 [physics.data-an])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03845</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03845</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Williams and Beer (2010) proposed a nonnegative mutual information
decomposition, based on the construction of redundancy lattices, which allows
separating the information that a set of variables contains about a target
variable into nonnegative components interpretable as the unique information of
some variables not contained in others as well as redundant and synergistic
components. However, the definition of multivariate measures of redundancy that
comply with nonnegativity and conform to certain axioms that capture
conceptually desirable properties of redundancy has proven to be elusive. We
here present a procedure to determine multivariate redundancy measures, within
the framework of maximum entropy models. In particular, we generalize existing
bivariate maximum entropy-based measures of redundancy and unique information,
defining measures of the redundant information that a group of variables has
about a target, and of the unique redundant information that a group of
variables has about a target that is not redundant with information from
another group. The two key ingredients for this approach are: First, the
identification of a type of constraints on entropy maximization that allows
isolating components of redundancy and unique redundancy by mirroring them to
synergy components. Second, the construction of rooted tree-based
decompositions to breakdown mutual information, ensuring nonnegativity by the
local implementation of maximum entropy information projections at each binary
unfolding of the tree nodes. Altogether, the proposed measures are nonnegative
and conform to the desirable axioms for redundancy measures.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effects of pitch and timing expectancy on musical emotion. (arXiv:1708.03687v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03687</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03687</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pitch and timing information work hand in hand to create a coherent piece of
music; but what happens when this information goes against the norm?
Relationships between musical expectancy and emotional responses were
investigated in a study conducted with 40 participants: 20 musicians and 20
non-musicians. Participants took part in one of two behavioural paradigms
measuring continuous expectancy or emotional responses (arousal and valence)
while listening to folk melodies that exhibited either high or low pitch
predictability and high or low onset predictability. The causal influence of
pitch predictability was investigated in an additional condition where pitch
was artificially manipulated and a comparison conducted between original and
manipulated forms; the dynamic correlative influence of pitch and timing
information and its perception on emotional change during listening was
evaluated using cross-sectional time series analysis. The results indicate that
pitch and onset predictability are consistent predictors of perceived
expectancy and emotional response, with onset carrying more weight than pitch.
In addition, musicians and non-musicians do not differ in their responses,
possibly due to shared cultural background and knowledge. The results
demonstrate in a controlled lab-based setting a precise, quantitative
relationship between the predictability of musical structure, expectation and
emotional response.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03666</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03666</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;While musicians generally perform better than non-musicians in various
auditory discrimination tasks, effects of specific instrumental training have
received little attention. The effects of instrument-specific musical training
on auditory grouping in the context of stream segregation are investigated here
in three experiments. In Experiment 1a, participants listened to sequences of
ABA tones and indicated when they heard a change in rhythm. This change is
caused by the manipulation of the B tones' timbre and indexes a change in
perception from integration to segregation, or vice versa. While it was
expected that musicians would detect a change in rhythm earlier when their own
instrument was involved, no such pattern was observed. In Experiment 1b,
designed to control for potential expectation effects in Experiment 1a,
participants heard sequences of static ABA tones and reported their initial
perceptions, whether the sequence was integrated or segregated. Results show
that participants tend to initially perceive these static sequences as
segregated, and that perception is influenced by similarity between the timbres
involved. Finally, in Experiment 2 violinists and flautists located mistuned
notes in an interleaved melody paradigm containing a violin and a flute melody.
Performance did not depend on the instrument the participant played but rather
which melody their attention was directed to. Taken together, results from the
three experiments suggest that the specific instrument one practices does not
have an influence on auditory grouping, but attentional mechanisms are
necessary for processing auditory scenes.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Encoding Sensory and Motor Patterns as Time-Invariant Trajectories in Recurrent Neural Networks. (arXiv:1701.00838v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00838</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Much of the information the brain processes and stores is temporal in nature
- a spoken word or a handwritten signature, for example, is defined by how it
unfolds in time. However, it remains unclear how neural circuits encode complex
time-varying patterns. We show that by tuning the weights of a recurrent neural
network (RNN), it can recognize and then transcribe spoken digits. The model
elucidates how neural dynamics in cortical networks may resolve three
fundamental challenges: first, encode multiple time-varying sensory and motor
patterns as stable neural trajectories; second, generalize across relevant
spatial features; third, identify the same stimuli played at different speeds -
we show that this temporal invariance emerges because the recurrent dynamics
generate neural trajectories with appropriately modulated angular velocities.
Together our results generate testable predictions as to how recurrent networks
may use different mechanisms to generalize across the relevant spatial and
temporal features of complex time-varying stimuli.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Maike K. Aurich, Ronan M. T. Fleming, Ines Thiele&lt;/p&gt;

The metabolic phenotype of cancer cells is reflected by the metabolites they consume and by the byproducts they release. Here, we use quantitative, extracellular metabolomic data of the NCI-60 panel and a novel computational method to generate 120 condition-specific cancer cell line metabolic models. These condition-specific cancer models used distinct metabolic strategies to generate energy and cofactors. The analysis of the models’ capability to deal with environmental perturbations revealed three oxotypes, differing in the range of allowable oxygen uptake rates. Interestingly, models based on metabolomic profiles of melanoma cells were distinguished from other models through their low oxygen uptake rates, which were associated with a glycolytic phenotype. A subset of the melanoma cell models required reductive carboxylation. The analysis of protein and RNA expression levels from the Human Protein Atlas showed that IDH2, which was an essential gene in the melanoma models, but not IDH1 protein, was detected in normal skin cell types and melanoma. Moreover, the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) protein, whose loss is associated with non-hypoxic HIF-stabilization, reductive carboxylation, and promotion of glycolysis, was uniformly absent in melanoma. Thus, the experimental data supported the predicted role of IDH2 and the absence of VHL protein supported the glycolytic and low oxygen phenotype predicted for melanoma. Taken together, our approach of integrating extracellular metabolomic data with metabolic modeling and the combination of different network interrogation methods allowed insights into the metabolism of cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CIEqJpEHAGU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Increasing robustness of pairwise methods for effective connectivity in Magnetic Resonance Imaging by using fractional moment series of BOLD signal distributions. (arXiv:1606.08724v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08724</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Estimating causal interactions in the brain from functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains a formidable task. Multiple studies have
demonstrated that essentially all current analytical approaches to determine
effective connectivity perform poorly even when applied to synthetic fMRI
datasets. Recent advances in this field include methods for pairwise inference,
which involve creating a sparse connectome in the first step of the inference,
and then using a classifier in order to determine the directionality of every
connection in the second step. In this work, we propose an advance to the
second step of this inference procedure, by building a classifier based on all
moments of the BOLD distribution combined into cumulants. The classifier is
trained on a dataset generated under under the Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM)
generative model (Friston et al, 2003). First, we evaluated the performance of
this classifier on synthetic benchmark datasets. Secondly, we simulated the DCM
generative model with natural confounds present in the fMRI datasets such as
varying signal magnitudes and noise variances between the upstream and
downstream regions. Our approach outperforms other methods for effective
connectivity research when applied to the benchmark datasets, but crucially, it
is also more resilient to known confounding effects such as differential noise
level across different areas of the connectome. This suggests that the
classifier proposed in this work can be recommended for further validation on
the human fMRI datasets.

	<description>In physiological conditions, adult neurons have low intracellular Cl− [(Cl−)I] levels underlying the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory drive. In contrast, neurons have high (Cl−)I levels and excitatory GABA actions in a wide range of pathological conditions including spinal cord lesions, chronic pain, brain trauma, cerebrovascular infarcts, autism, Rett and Down syndrome, various types of epilepsies, and other genetic or environmental insults. The diuretic highly specific NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide (PubChem CID: 2461) efficiently restores low (Cl−)I levels and attenuates many disorders in experimental conditions and in some clinical trials.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: MicroRNA-137 and -195* inhibit vasculogenesis in brain arteriovenous malformations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25015</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25015</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives&lt;/b&gt;: Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common cause of non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage in young adults. The genesis of brain AVM remains enigmatic. We investigated microRNA (miRNA) expression and its contribution to the pathogenesis of brain AVMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We used a large-scale miRNA analysis on 16 samples including AVMs, hemangioblastoma, and controls to identify a distinct AVM miRNA signature. AVM smooth muscle cells (AVMSMCs) were isolated and identified by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry and candidate miRNAs were then tested in these cells. Migration, tube formation, and CCK-8-induced proliferation assays were used to test the miRNAs effect on phenotypic properties of AVMSMCs. A quantitative proteomics approach was used to identify protein expression changes in AVMSMCs treated with miRNA mimics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: A distinct AVM miRNA signature comprising a large portion of lowly expressed miRNAs was identified. Among these miRNAs, miR-137 and miR-195* levels were significantly decreased in AVMs and constituent AVMSMCs. Experimentally elevating the level of these microRNAs inhibited AVMSMC migration, tube formation and survival in vitro and the formation of vascular rings &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Proteomics showed the protein expression signature of AVMSMCs and identified downstream proteins regulated by miR-137 and miR-195* which were key signaling proteins involved in vessel development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results indicate that miR-137 and miR-195* act as vasculogenic suppressors in AVMs by altering phenotypic properties of AVMSMCs, and that the absence of miR-137 and miR-195* expression leads to abnormal vasculogenesis.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Confirmation bias in human reinforcement learning: Evidence from counterfactual feedback processing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefano Palminteri, Germain Lefebvre, Emma J. Kilford, Sarah-Jayne Blakemore&lt;/p&gt;

Previous studies suggest that &lt;i&gt;factual&lt;/i&gt; learning, that is, learning from obtained outcomes, is biased, such that participants preferentially take into account positive, as compared to negative, prediction errors. However, whether or not the prediction error valence also affects &lt;i&gt;counterfactual&lt;/i&gt; learning, that is, learning from forgone outcomes, is unknown. To address this question, we analysed the performance of two groups of participants on reinforcement learning tasks using a computational model that was adapted to test if prediction error valence influences learning. We carried out two experiments: in the factual learning experiment, participants learned from partial feedback (i.e., the outcome of the chosen option only); in the counterfactual learning experiment, participants learned from complete feedback information (i.e., the outcomes of both the chosen and unchosen option were displayed). In the factual learning experiment, we replicated previous findings of a valence-induced bias, whereby participants learned preferentially from positive, relative to negative, prediction errors. In contrast, for counterfactual learning, we found the opposite valence-induced bias: negative prediction errors were preferentially taken into account, relative to positive ones. When considering valence-induced bias in the context of both factual and counterfactual learning, it appears that people tend to preferentially take into account information that confirms their current choice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Vp-TzL0UIhc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neutrophil extracellular traps in ischemic stroke thrombi</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24993-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been shown to promote thrombus formation. Little is known about the exact composition of thrombi that cause ischemic stroke. In particular, no information is yet available on the presence of NETs in cerebral occlusions. Such information is, however, essential to improve current thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). This study aimed at investigating the presence of neutrophils and more specifically NETs in ischemic stroke thrombi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24993-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-eight thrombi retrieved from ischemic stroke patients undergoing endovascular treatment were characterized by immunostaining using neutrophil markers (CD66b and neutrophil elastase) and NET markers (citrullinated histone H3 [H3Cit] and extracellular DNA). Neutrophils and NETs were quantified. In addition, extracellular DNA was targeted by performing ex vivo lysis of retrieved thrombi with DNase 1 and t-PA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24993-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils were detected extensively throughout all thrombi. H3Cit, a hallmark of NETs, was observed in almost all thrombi. H3Cit-positive area varied up to 13.45% of total thrombus area. Colocalization of H3Cit with extracellular DNA released from neutrophils confirmed the specific presence of NETs. H3Cit was more abundant in thrombi of cardioembolic origin compared to other etiologies. Older thrombi contained significantly more neutrophils and H3Cit compared to fresh thrombi. Interestingly, ex vivo lysis of patient thrombi was more successful when adding DNase 1 to standard t-PA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24993-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils and NETs form important constituents of cerebral thrombi. Targeting of NETs with DNase 1 might have prothrombolytic potential in treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

massively parallel computational architectures. Here, we show that these two
characteristics are in tension, reflecting a fundamental tradeoff between
interactive parallelism that supports learning and generalization, and
independent parallelism that supports processing efficiency through concurrent
multitasking. We formally show that, while the maximum number of tasks that can
be performed simultaneously grows linearly with network size, under realistic
scenarios (e.g. in an unpredictable environment), the expected number that can
be performed concurrently grows radically sub-linearly with network size.
Hence, even modest reliance on shared representation strictly constrains the
number of tasks that can be performed simultaneously, implying profound
consequences for the development of artificial intelligence that optimally
manages the tradeoff between learning and processing, and for understanding the
human brains remarkably puzzling mix of sequential and parallel capabilities.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Great Than The Sum: Integrated Information In Large Brain Networks. (arXiv:1708.02967v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent work in information theory has produced a sound measure of integrated
information based on time-series data, which quantifies how much more
information a system carries than the sum of its parts. As a principled measure
of global information in complex systems, integrated information holds the
promise of transforming a number of scientific fields, particularly
neuroscience. Unfortunately, the measurement of integrated information involves
a combinatorial search problem, which has made it impossible to measure this
quantity in large systems such as brains. Here, we present a solution to this
problem, reducing the computation time for large systems from longer than the
timespan of the universe to just several hours. After evaluating our solution,
we demonstrate that brain connectomes are structured in ways that facilitate
high integrated information and provide the first measurement of integrated
information in a real nervous system: the brain of Caenorhabditis elegans.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Simple Analysis of Sparse, Sign-Consistent JL. (arXiv:1708.02966v1 [cs.DS])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02966</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02966</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Allen-Zhu, Gelashvili, Micali, and Shavit constructed a sparse,
sign-consistent Johnson Lindenstrauss distribution, and proved that this
distribution yields an essentially optimal dimension for the correct choice of
sparsity. However, their analysis of the upper bound on the dimension and
sparsity required a complicated combinatorial graph-based argument similar to
Kane and Nelson's analysis of sparse JL. We present a simple,
combinatorics-free analysis of sparse, sign-consistent JL that yields the same
dimension and sparsity upper bounds as the original analysis. Our proof also
yields dimension/sparsity tradeoffs, which were not previously known.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with previous proofs in this area, our analysis is based on applying
Markov's inequality to the $p$th moment of an error term that can be expressed
as a quadratic form of Rademacher variables. Interestingly, we show that,
unlike in previous work in the area, the traditionally used Hanson-Wright bound
is not strong enough to yield our desired result. Indeed, although the
Hanson-Wright bound is known to be optimal for gaussian degree-2 chaos, it was
already shown to be suboptimal for Rademachers. Surprisingly, we are able to
show a simple moment bound for quadratic forms of Rademachers that is
sufficiently tight to achieve our desired result, which given the ubiquity of
moment and tail bounds in theoretical computer science, is likely to be of
broader interest.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Natural history of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease during childhood</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25009</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To determine the rate of disease progression in a longitudinal natural history study of children with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: 206 (103 female) participants aged 3-20 years enrolled in the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium were assessed at baseline and 2-years. Demographic, anthropometric, and diagnostic information were collected. Disease progression was assessed with the CMT Pediatric Scale (CMTPedS), a reliable Rasch-built linearly weighted disability scale evaluating fine and gross motor function, strength, sensation, and balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: On average CMTPedS Total scores progressed at a rate of 2.4±4.9 over 2-years (14% change from baseline, p&amp;lt;0.001). There was no difference between males and females (mean difference 0.5, 95%CI -0.9 to 1.9, p=0.49). The most responsive CMTPedS items were dorsiflexion strength (z-score change: -0.3, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.05, p=0.02), balance (z-score change: -1.0, 95% CI -1.9 to -0.09, p=0.03), and long jump (z-score change: -0.4, 95% CI -0.7 to -0.02, p=0.04). Of the most common genetic subtypes, 111 participants with CMT1A/&lt;em&gt;PMP22&lt;/em&gt; duplication progressed by 1.8±4.2 (12% change from baseline, p&amp;lt;0.001), nine participants with CMT1B/&lt;em&gt;MPZ&lt;/em&gt; mutation progressed by 2.2±5.1 (11% change), six participants with CMT2A/&lt;em&gt;MFN2&lt;/em&gt; mutation progressed by 6.2±7.9 (23% change), and seven participants with CMT4C/&lt;em&gt;SH3TC2&lt;/em&gt; mutations progressed by 3.0±4.5 (12% change). Participants with CMT2A progressed faster than CMT1A (mean difference -4.4, 95%CI -8.1 to -0.8, p=0.02). Children with CMT1A progressed consistently through early childhood (3-10 years) and adolescence (11-20 years) (mean difference 1.1, 95%CI -0.6 to 2.7, p=0.19) while CMT2A appeared to progress faster during early childhood than adolescence (mean difference 10.0, 95%CI -2.2 to 22.2, p=0.08).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Using the CMTPedS as an outcome measure of disease severity, children with CMT progress at a significant rate over 2-years. Understanding the rate at which children with CMT deteriorate is essential for adequately powering trials of disease-modifying interventions. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gustatory and olfactory responses to stimulation of the human insula</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25010</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25010</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Despite numerous studies suggesting the role of insular cortex in the processing of gustatory and olfactory inputs, the exact location of olfacto-gustatory representation in the insula remains controversial. Here we provide a functional mapping of olfactory-gustatory responses to stimulation of the human insular cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We reviewed 651 electrical stimulations of the insula that were performed in 221 patients, using stereotactically implanted depth electrodes, during the pre-surgical evaluation of drug refractory epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Gustatory sensations were evoked in 15 (2.7%) of the 550 stimulations that elicited a clinical response. They were exclusively obtained after stimulation of a relatively delimited zone of insula, located in its mid-dorsal part (posterior short gyrus). Six olfactory sensations (1.1%) could be obtained during stimulations of an insular region that partially overlapped with the gustatory representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our study provides a functional mapping of gustatory representation in the insular posterior short gyrus and the first detailed description of olfactory sensations obtained by direct stimulation of mid-dorsal insula. Our data also show a spatial overlap between gustatory, olfactory and oral somatosensory representation in the mid-dorsal insula, and suggest that this part of the insula may be an integrated oral sensory region that plays a key role in flavor perception. It also indicates that dysfunction in this region should be considered during the evaluation of gustatory and olfactory epileptic seizures. This article is protected by copyright.

Two distinct MRI patterns of spinal cord involvement were described according to T2-weighted (T2W) axial images: (1) “Bagel Sign” pattern: a central lesion with hypointense core and hyperintense rim with or without contrast enhancement; and (2) “Motor Neuron” pattern: a symmetric involvement of the anterior horn cells. Bagel Sign was present in 13 of 14 myelopathy episodes whereas Motor Neuron pattern was observed in 1 of 14 MRIs. Of the 13 MRIs with Bagel Sign long myelopathy (n = 9), both long and short myelopathy (n = 2) and short myelopathy (n = 2) was observed. All patterns cleared with some residual lesions after steroid use and immunomodulation with associated clinical recovery in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>Deficits in GABAergic inhibition result in the abnormal neuronal activation and synchronization that underlies seizures. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for transforming a normal brain into an epileptic one remain largely unknown. Hyperpolarizing inhibition mediated by type A GABA (GABAA) receptors is dependent on chloride extrusion by the neuron-specific type 2K+–Cl− cotransporter (KCC2). Loss-of-function mutations in KCC2 are a known cause of infantile epilepsy in humans and KCC2 dysfunction is present in patients with both idiopathic and acquired epilepsy.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Combined electroencephalography–functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrical source imaging improves localization of pediatric focal epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25003</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25003-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgical treatment in epilepsy is effective if the epileptogenic zone (EZ) can be correctly localized and characterized. Here we use simultaneous electroencephalography–functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) data to derive EEG-fMRI and electrical source imaging (ESI) maps. Their yield and their individual and combined ability to (1) localize the EZ and (2) predict seizure outcome were then evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25003-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-three children with drug-resistant epilepsy underwent EEG-fMRI. Interictal discharges were mapped using both EEG-fMRI hemodynamic responses and ESI. A single localization was derived from each individual test (EEG-fMRI global maxima [GM]/ESI maximum) and from the combination of both maps (EEG-fMRI/ESI spatial intersection). To determine the localization accuracy and its predictive performance, the individual and combined test localizations were compared to the presumed EZ and to the postsurgical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25003-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-two of 53 patients had significant maps: 47 of 53 for EEG-fMRI, 44 of 53 for ESI, and 34 of 53 for both. The EZ was well characterized in 29 patients; 26 had an EEG-fMRI GM localization that was correct in 11, 22 patients had ESI localization that was correct in 17, and 12 patients had combined EEG-fMRI and ESI that was correct in 11. Seizure outcome following resection was correctly predicted by EEG-fMRI GM in 8 of 20 patients, and by the ESI maximum in 13 of 16. The combined EEG-fMRI/ESI region entirely predicted outcome in 9 of 9 patients, including 3 with no lesion visible on MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous estimates of the utility of polygenic risk score analysis for the prediction of Alzheimer disease have given area under the curve (AUC) estimates of &amp;lt;80%. However, these have been based on the genetic analysis of clinical case–control series. Here, we apply the same analytic approaches to a pathological case–control series and show a predictive AUC of 84%. We suggest that this analysis has clinical utility and that there is limited room for further improvement using genetic data. Ann Neurol 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of rituximab in patients with stiff person syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25002</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25002-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stiff person syndrome (SPS), an antibody-mediated impaired γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurotransmission is believed to cause muscle stiffness and spasms. Most patients improve with GABA-enhancing drugs and intravenous immunoglobulin, but some respond poorly and remain disabled. The need for more effective therapy prompted a trial with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25002-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a placebo-controlled randomized trial of rituximab (2 biweekly infusions of 1g each). The primary outcome was a change in stiffness scores at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were changes in heightened-sensitivity and quality of life scores. Enrolling 24 patients was calculated to detect 50% change in stiffness scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25002-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randomization was balanced for age, sex, disease duration, and glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody titers. No significant changes were noted at 6 months after treatment in all outcomes. Specifically, no differences were noted in the stiffness index, the primary outcome, or sensitivity scores, the secondary outcome, at 3 or 6 months. Quality of life scores improved significantly (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) at 3 months in both groups, but not at 6 months, denoting an early placebo effect. Blinded self-assessment rating of the overall stiffness for individual patients revealed improvement in 4 patients in each group. At 6 months, improvement persisted in 1 patient in the placebo group versus 3 of 4 in the rituximab group, where these meaningful improvements were also captured by video recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25002-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the largest controlled trial conducted in SPS patients and demonstrates no statistically significant difference in the efficacy measures between rituximab and placebo. Rituximab's lack of efficacy could be due to a considerable placebo effect; insensitivity of scales to quantify stiffness, especially in the less severely affected patients; or drug effectiveness in only a small patient subset.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Revisiting chemoaffinity theory: Chemotactic implementation of topographic axonal projection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005702</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Honda Naoki&lt;/p&gt;

Neural circuits are wired by chemotactic migration of growth cones guided by extracellular guidance cue gradients. How growth cone chemotaxis builds the macroscopic structure of the neural circuit is a fundamental question in neuroscience. I addressed this issue in the case of the ordered axonal projections called topographic maps in the retinotectal system. In the retina and tectum, the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, are expressed in gradients. According to Sperry’s chemoaffinity theory, gradients in both the source and target areas enable projecting axons to recognize their proper terminals, but how axons chemotactically decode their destinations is largely unknown. To identify the chemotactic mechanism of topographic mapping, I developed a mathematical model of intracellular signaling in the growth cone that focuses on the growth cone’s unique chemotactic property of being attracted or repelled by the same guidance cues in different biological situations. The model presented mechanism by which the retinal growth cone reaches the correct terminal zone in the tectum through alternating chemotactic response between attraction and repulsion around a preferred concentration. The model also provided a unified understanding of the contrasting relationships between receptor expression levels and preferred ligand concentrations in EphA/ephrinA- and EphB/ephrinB-encoded topographic mappings. Thus, this study redefines the chemoaffinity theory in chemotactic terms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xQ8uHxQvkZ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Stabilization of diastolic calcium signal via calcium pump regulation of complex local calcium releases and transient decay in a computational model of cardiac pacemaker cell with individual release channels</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005675</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexander V. Maltsev, Victor A. Maltsev, Michael D. Stern&lt;/p&gt;

Intracellular Local Ca releases (LCRs) from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) regulate cardiac pacemaker cell function by activation of electrogenic Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) during diastole. Prior studies demonstrated the existence of powerful compensatory mechanisms of LCR regulation via a complex local cross-talk of Ca pump, release and NCX. One major obstacle to study these mechanisms is that LCR exhibit complex Ca release propagation patterns (including merges and separations) that have not been characterized. Here we developed new terminology, classification, and computer algorithms for automatic detection of numerically simulated LCRs and examined LCR regulation by SR Ca pumping rate (Pup) that provides a major contribution to fight-or-flight response. In our simulations the faster SR Ca pumping accelerates action potential-induced Ca transient decay and quickly clears Ca under the cell membrane in diastole, preventing premature releases. Then the SR generates an earlier, more synchronized, and stronger diastolic LCR signal activating an earlier and larger inward NCX current. LCRs at higher Pup exhibit larger amplitudes and faster propagation with more collisions to each other. The LCRs overlap with Ca transient decay, causing an elevation of the average diastolic [Ca] nadir to ~200 nM (at Pup = 24 mM/s). Background Ca (in locations lacking LCRs) quickly decays to resting Ca levels (&amp;lt;100 nM) at high Pup, but remained elevated during slower decay at low Pup. Release propagation is facilitated at higher Pup by a larger LCR amplitude, whereas at low Pup by higher background Ca. While at low Pup LCRs show smaller amplitudes, their larger durations and sizes combined with longer transient decay stabilize integrals of diastolic Ca and NCX current signals. Thus, the local interplay of SR Ca pump and release channels regulates LCRs and Ca transient decay to insure fail-safe pacemaker cell operation within a wide range of rates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dASMjVRMMU8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A stochastic-field description of finite-size spiking neural networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005691</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Grégory Dumont, Alexandre Payeur, André Longtin&lt;/p&gt;

Neural network dynamics are governed by the interaction of spiking neurons. Stochastic aspects of single-neuron dynamics propagate up to the network level and shape the dynamical and informational properties of the population. Mean-field models of population activity disregard the finite-size stochastic fluctuations of network dynamics and thus offer a deterministic description of the system. Here, we derive a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) describing the temporal evolution of the finite-size refractory density, which represents the proportion of neurons in a given refractory state at any given time. The population activity—the density of active neurons per unit time—is easily extracted from this refractory density. The SPDE includes finite-size effects through a two-dimensional Gaussian white noise that acts both in time and along the refractory dimension. For an infinite number of neurons the standard mean-field theory is recovered. A discretization of the SPDE along its characteristic curves allows direct simulations of the activity of large but finite spiking networks; this constitutes the main advantage of our approach. Linearizing the SPDE with respect to the deterministic asynchronous state allows the theoretical investigation of finite-size activity fluctuations. In particular, analytical expressions for the power spectrum and autocorrelation of activity fluctuations are obtained. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to incorporate multiple interacting populations and quasi-renewal single-neuron dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DIIBywIdo30&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Computational-experimental approach to drug-target interaction mapping: A case study on kinase inhibitors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005678</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Cichonska, Balaguru Ravikumar, Elina Parri, Sanna Timonen, Tapio Pahikkala, Antti Airola, Krister Wennerberg, Juho Rousu, Tero Aittokallio&lt;/p&gt;

Due to relatively high costs and labor required for experimental profiling of the full target space of chemical compounds, various machine learning models have been proposed as cost-effective means to advance this process in terms of predicting the most potent compound-target interactions for subsequent verification. However, most of the model predictions lack direct experimental validation in the laboratory, making their practical benefits for drug discovery or repurposing applications largely unknown. Here, we therefore introduce and carefully test a systematic computational-experimental framework for the prediction and pre-clinical verification of drug-target interactions using a well-established kernel-based regression algorithm as the prediction model. To evaluate its performance, we first predicted unmeasured binding affinities in a large-scale kinase inhibitor profiling study, and then experimentally tested 100 compound-kinase pairs. The relatively high correlation of 0.77 (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) between the predicted and measured bioactivities supports the potential of the model for filling the experimental gaps in existing compound-target interaction maps. Further, we subjected the model to a more challenging task of predicting target interactions for such a new candidate drug compound that lacks prior binding profile information. As a specific case study, we used tivozanib, an investigational VEGF receptor inhibitor with currently unknown off-target profile. Among 7 kinases with high predicted affinity, we experimentally validated 4 new off-targets of tivozanib, namely the Src-family kinases &lt;i&gt;FRK&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FYN A&lt;/i&gt;, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase &lt;i&gt;ABL1&lt;/i&gt;, and the serine/threonine kinase &lt;i&gt;SLK&lt;/i&gt;. Our sub-sequent experimental validation protocol effectively avoids any possible information leakage between the training and validation data, and therefore enables rigorous model validation for practical applications. These results demonstrate that the kernel-based modeling approach offers practical benefits for probing novel insights into the mode of action of investigational compounds, and for the identification of new target selectivities for drug repurposing applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s7EYPlElWuE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multi-scale approaches for high-speed imaging and analysis of large neural populations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005685</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Johannes Friedrich, Weijian Yang, Daniel Soudry, Yu Mu, Misha B. Ahrens, Rafael Yuste, Darcy S. Peterka, Liam Paninski&lt;/p&gt;

Progress in modern neuroscience critically depends on our ability to observe the activity of large neuronal populations with cellular spatial and high temporal resolution. However, two bottlenecks constrain efforts towards fast imaging of large populations. First, the resulting large video data is challenging to analyze. Second, there is an explicit tradeoff between imaging speed, signal-to-noise, and field of view: with current recording technology we cannot image very large neuronal populations with simultaneously high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we describe multi-scale approaches for alleviating both of these bottlenecks. First, we show that spatial and temporal decimation techniques based on simple local averaging provide order-of-magnitude speedups in spatiotemporally demixing calcium video data into estimates of single-cell neural activity. Second, once the shapes of individual neurons have been identified at fine scale (e.g., after an initial phase of conventional imaging with standard temporal and spatial resolution), we find that the spatial/temporal resolution tradeoff shifts dramatically: after demixing we can accurately recover denoised fluorescence traces and deconvolved neural activity of each individual neuron from coarse scale data that has been spatially decimated by an order of magnitude. This offers a cheap method for compressing this large video data, and also implies that it is possible to either speed up imaging significantly, or to “zoom out” by a corresponding factor to image order-of-magnitude larger neuronal populations with minimal loss in accuracy or temporal resolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LspwfQbTRFU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Neurons have diverse molecular, morphological, connectional and functional properties. We believe that the only realistic way to manage this complexity — and thereby pave the way for understanding the structure, function and development of brain circuits — is to group neurons into types, which can &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used antidepressants; however, their mechanism of action is elusive. The authors here show that activation of serotonin 5-HT1B receptors on cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons (CCK neurons) in the dentate gyrus underlies the effects of acute SSRI treatment on &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuronal loss is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), but the mechanisms through which the neurons die are unclear. Here, the authors described evidence for the activation of necroptosis — a programmed form of necrosis that has been implicated in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional connectivity analyses of group data have revealed several large-scale distributed brain networks, including the default network (DN), frontoparietal control network (FPN) and dorsal attention network (dATN); however, few studies have examined network organization within individual subjects. The authors performed multiple functional MRI scans in &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain is a common adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents, such as oxaliplatin. The authors here showed that antibiotic-mediated eradication of the gut microbiota protects mice against both oxaliplatin-induced inflammation in the dorsal root ganglia and mechanical hyperalgesia. The permissive effect of the gut microbiota &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of winning a bout of competitive behaviour is increased by past wins, and the neural circuitry underlying this crucial determinant of social rank in a group of mice is identified as a projection from the mediodorsal thalamus to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Stress is a primary risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders; at times, even a single trauma can trigger psychopathology. Many rodent models of neuropsychiatric disorders use chronic stress, measuring readouts at the end of long protocols. In a way, traditional chronic models overlook a crucial question: how does the physiological response to stressor(s) turn into a maladaptive pathway that may verge towards psychopathology? Recent evidence suggests that studying the long-term consequences of acute stress would provide critical information on the role of stress in psychopathology.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Loss of inhibition in a circuit in the primary somatosensory cortex that controls the activity of layer 5 neurons drives pain hypersensitivity. Restoring this inhibition resets the inhibitory–excitatory balance, producing analgesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness of EGFR treatment is impaired through an early adaptive response. TNF–JNK–Axl–ERK signaling contributes to this primary resistance to EGFR inhibition and might serve as novel target to improve EGFR inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Astroglial Versus Neuronal D-Serine: Check Your Controls!</title>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30125-X?rss=yes</link>
	<description>As we recently reviewed [1], studies from at least six laboratories now indicate that neurons rather than astrocytes are the major sources for D-serine and preferentially express its synthetic enzyme, serine racemase (SR), in the normal brain [1]. We described how several unforeseen artifacts misled established scientists (including ourselves) into believing that serine racemase and D-serine are localized exclusively to astrocytes and represent prima face exemplars of gliotransmission. We were concerned that the purported astrocytic source of D-serine was being perpetuated to this day, despite compelling evidence to the contrary published over the past decade [1].</description>

&lt;p&gt;Microglia play a part in protein clearance and synaptic pruning. This latter process is re-activated in Alzheimer disease (AD) and promoted by amyloid-β (Aβ). A screen of 18 AD-associated genes revealed that loss of the DNA–RNA binding protein TDP43 led to a considerable increase in &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mice, the ventricular–subventricular zone (V–SVZ) continuously produces neural stem cells (NSCs). Proopiomelanocortin-expressing (POMC+) neurons of the hypothalamus were found to project selectively to anterior ventral (AV) regions of the V–SVZ. Ablation of these neurons decreased NSC proliferation selectively in the AV V–SVZ, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory traces of long-term auditory fear memories are stored in the auditory cortex. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are stable components of the extracellular matrix that could potentially provide a scaffold for long-term synaptic plasticity. In a model of auditory fear conditioning, mRNAs encoding three lecticans — &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in Parkinson disease (PD) will be to turn an emerging and expanding pipeline of novel disease-modifying candidate compounds into therapeutics. Novel targets need in vivo validation, and candidate therapeutics require appropriate preclinical platforms on which to define potential efficacy and target &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Subcortical Contributions to Motor Speech: Phylogenetic, Developmental, Clinical</title>

	<description>Vocal learning is an exclusively human trait among primates. However, songbirds demonstrate behavioral features resembling human speech learning. Two circuits have a preeminent role in this human behavior; namely, the corticostriatal and the cerebrocerebellar motor loops. While the striatal contribution can be traced back to the avian anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), the sensorimotor adaptation functions of the cerebellum appear to be human specific in acoustic communication. This review contributes to an ongoing discussion on how birdsong translates into human speech.</description>
